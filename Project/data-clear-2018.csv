0;798274953;20181029;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/25313/blockchain/blockchain-indonesia/;"Following in the steps of international counterparts, Indonesia is setting its sights on blockchain as an enabler of increased efficiency and greater transparency with applications currently being explored in areas and industries that include e-voting and agriculture.

Melbourne-based startup Horizon State, which was recently named one of the World Economic Forum’s Tech Pioneers, announced in July a project to roll out a community voter platform built on blockchain technology in the island of Sumatra which it hopes to scale-up for regional and national government elections in Indonesia.

“We’re in interesting dialogue at the moment with national and regional governments, which are interested in the future to use of the technology in regional and national government elections in the region,” Horizon State CEO Oren Alazraki told ABC.

The Sumatra project focuses on providing the 92 million members of Indonesia’s largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, with a digital ballot box on their mobile phones that allows them to vote on key decisions affecting their community, such as electing leaders, allocating funds and deciding on community projects.

In this particular use case, blockchain technology promises to provide trust in the electoral process itself as well as very low cost ways of verifying that these votes took place.

Another topic that’s got people excited is the use of blockchain in the agricultural sector. Startup HARA Token is trying to get Indonesia’s rice growers on the blockchain.

The company wants to use critical information like soil quality, grain price, and land ownership from farmers and field agents to help Indonesian farmers increase annual yields. Farmers who input this data into the blockchain will be rewarded with HARA Tokens, which can be exchanged for needed goods like fertilizer.

In the end, this could help make farmers more plugged-in and knowledgeable about prices, sales, and best practices. Meanwhile, NGOs and government institutions could gain access to a valuable data set that shows what’s happening in the rice sector in real time.

HARA Token wants to reach 2 million farmers by 2020 but by September 2018, they’ve only reached 7,000.

Earlier this year, tech firm Online Pajak launched a blockchain-driven app that allows customers to share encrypted tax data with institutions such as the tax and treasury offices, banks and the central bank.

As well as increasing transparency and reducing paperwork and errors, it would mean tax payers can know for sure they have paid their dues, said Online Pajak’s founder Charles Guinot.

Indonesia’s blockchain industry

Indonesia has witnessed the emergence of a blockchain industry in recent years. Although smaller and less developed than regional counterparts like Singapore, the country is home to several noteworthy startups including Pundi X, a maker of point-of-sale devices supporting cryptocurrency, and Indodax, formerly Bitcoin Indonesia, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

In August, it welcomed a new blockchain hub called Indonesia Blockchain Hub. The hub was launched to serve as a center for developing and promoting blockchain in the country, helping unify the efforts of various local communities, drive innovation and offer education.

According to reports, five major banks, Bank Negara Indonesia, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Bank Mandiri, Bank Danamon and Bank Permata, are toying with the idea of implementing blockchain in their systems.

While Indonesia has so far welcomed blockchain technology, it has taken a different stance towards cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Bank Indonesia banned fintech companies using cryptocurrencies for transactions, which doesn’t prohibit trading of the digital tokens itself.

Despite the prohibition, the regulator unveiled earlier this year plans to issue its own cryptocurrency or digital rupiah backed by blockchain technology.

An assistant to Bank Indonesia’s executive director for payment systems Susiato Dewi said the digital rupiah would be trialed this year in an effort to help make the payment system more efficient. Indonesia hopes to be the first country in the world to launch a digital currency.

The company, which plans to offer 130 million shares, or about a 34.21 per cent of its shares, at Rp 250-Rp 375 apiece, said its shares had been oversubscribed by more than 10.27 times during its offering period, 18-22 October .

From the IPO, the company has managed to raise almost Rp 501 billion ($32 million), more than double its initial target of Rp 48 billion, according to stock issuance guarantor Sinarmas Sekuritas, as reported by local media.

The company, which goes by the IDX ticker symbol YELO, becomes the 46th issuer in 2018, as well as the first startup built by the IDX Incubator to take part in the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

The IDX Incubator itself is a startup incubation programme initiated by the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK). The programme serves to help develop startups in Indonesia in terms of business, legal, and funding to allow them to list on the stock exchange.

Passpod CEO Hiro Whardana said, he hoped that the move can inspire other startups to continue to take note of various funding options.

“In the motivation we received from incubation process at IDX Incubator, not to wait for large growth before launching an IPO, as an IPO may actually help grow startups,” Whardana said.

Passpod, which describes itself as a ‘digital tourist pass’ for Indonesian travelers abroad, has three business segments, namely travel services, AI & big data, and global connectivity. As of April 2018, the company recorded Rp 475 million in net profit in the current period, up from Rp 26.5 million secured in the same period the previous year.

The proceeds from the IPO will be used for business development, research and development and capital expenditure in the form of additional modems and power banks. He added that the company will also be looking to expand into other services beyond modem rental.

The IPO makes Passpod the fourth tech company to be listed in the Indonesian bourse. The first Indonesia-based startup to IPO was O2O e-commerce company Kioson, which listed on the IDX last year and raised $3.4 million. It was followed by M Cash and NFC, which raised $22 million and $21 million in their IPO, respectively.

Like Passpod, all of its tech predecessor also saw their shares oversubscribed on their debut listing.

Indonesia is set to see a fifth tech startup go public before the end of the year. Publicly-listed investment firm Kresna Graha Investama, backer of both M Cash and NFC, recently told DEALSTREETASIA that it plans to take digital business enabler DIVA, another of its startups, to IPO at the end of the year.

The head of the Finance Ministry’s state revenue policy center, Rofyanto Kurniawan, said in Jakarta on Thursday that his office was focusing on helping e-commerce players create reports on their businesses for submission to the government.

“The initial step is to help e-commerce players make reports,” Rofyanto said as reported by kontan.co.id.

Taxation Director General Robert Pakpahan said the tax office was studying how to enforce tax compliance among digital businesses and that in the near future, his office would issue a regulation requiring e-commerce players to have tax numbers (NPWPs).

“By having an NPWP, they will be required to submit their business data to the taxation Directorate General so that self-assessment can be applied in tax returns,” Robert said.

Taxation Directorate General spokesman Hestu Yoga Saksama said that with the regulation, the target would be individuals and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that sell goods and services through e-commerce platforms.

Hestu said the platforms were expected to help the tax office encourage e-commerce players to obtain NPWPs. “The point is that e-commerce players can conveniently conduct business while also abiding by tax regulations,” he added.

The official added that the prevailing regulation on final income taxation that required MSMEs to pay 0.5 percent corporate income tax could be use to collect taxes from e-commerce players. (bbn)"
3;797801179;20181026;2018;https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/327143/digital-ad-marketplaces-dont-work-for-tv.html;"by Dave Morgan , Featured Contributor, October 25, 2018

For years, folks in the ad industry have talked wistfully of the day when TV advertising would be bought through automated online interfaces on auction-based bid marketplaces, as search, social and digital display advertising have been bought since the middle 2000s.

And some folks have done more than just talk. In 2003, a start-up called SpotRunner launched an online marketplace for local TV ads. It was shut down before the decade was out.

In 2007, eBay tried to create a TV ad marketplace, but it never even made it to the launch pad.

Also in 2007, Google created an online marketplace for TV ads, only to shut it down five years later. Microsoft bought a TV ad-tech company, Navic — or its Admira TV ad marketplace — but it didn’t make it much past 2010.

What gives? Why have some of the world’s largest tech companies failed at bringing marketplace technology to TV?

To me, the answer is pretty straightforward. Just as everything is a nail to a hammer, to most digital ad-tech companies, all media is like digital.

advertisement advertisement

Except, as anyone who truly knows TV knows, the world of TV advertising is nothing like digital. Here’s what I mean:

In TV advertising, demand exceeds supply. TV has a futures market, the upfront, because more advertisers want guaranteed placements on TV than there are placements to be sold. Thus, they must reserve them and lock in pricing many months in advance.

Digital doesn’t work that way. The vast majority of digital ads are not actually bought until a millisecond before they are served, or the availability perishes.

Real-time systems operate totally differently than futures systems do. Virtually all of the core ad technology that powers digital marketplaces — bidding, ad serving, optimization, demand-side platforms and sell-side platforms — operate on a real-time “waterfall” system, and have at their core real-time decisioning engines that optimize against an addressable media unit.

The digital ad-tech systems that can make the most optimal decisions against the largest pool of addressable units (browsers, apps, mobile phones, etc.) in the least amount of time win.

Not so in TV. The value — and optimization potential — in TV advertising is in the future, and the transaction unit is a TV spot. The vast, vast majority of TV spots are not addressable.

Thus, the purchased unit has to be viewed as a portfolio, not a person or browser or app, since every TV ad spot represents thousands or millions of different people that have different duplication and relative cost relationships to every other one of the spots available on TV during a campaign (every day, there are more than 250,000 spots on national TV).

Trying to predict and optimize TV ad campaigns with digital ad-tech systems is like trying to predict tsunamis off the coast of Indonesia six months in advance by sticking your hand out your Manhattan office window 10,000 times per second. Good luck with that.

TV networks have nothing to gain by exposing “unsold” inventory. Why do TV networks have special deals in place with direct-response advertisers, many of whom pay much lower rates than large brands do?

Because the structure of most of those deals permits the networks to preempt those ads at the last second with higher-paying ads, and having them in place guarantees scarcity of available impressions. That dynamic is critical in maintaining TV as a supply-constrained market.

In that world, TV networks gain nothing from exposing the volume or pricing of their unsold, or under-sold, inventory to buyers. In the digital ad world, publishers must push their “avails” information and status directly into the buyers’ interfaces, to be picked off at the last moment.

In the TV world, it is the opposite. Buyers’ demand — the amount that advertisers or agencies are willing to bid and pay for specific TV spots or audiences — needs to be pushed all the way into sellers’ interfaces, with sellers able to unilaterally accept or reject those bids each and every time.

This mismatch between the interests of TV sellers, and the design and operation of digital ad-tech systems built for a marketplace where buyers rule, is one of the most fundamental reasons we’ve seen so many digitally inspired marketplaces fail in the world of TV advertising.

Will all this change? Will we see marketplaces purpose-built for the TV ad ecosystem? For sure. It’s an area I’ve been personally focused on, and we’ve heard from a lot of the large TV ad market participants like AT&T’s Xandr and Comcast that they’re headed there, too. This will be fun to watch.

Customers mill about the sprawling, 60,000 square feet store browsing multiple shelves of imported items and checking out the fresh produce on offer.

Some gawk as overhead conveyor belts transport bags of packed groceries, ordered by online customers, across the store in preparation for delivery, as others gather around the automated checkout area (there are no cashiers) to push their supermarket trolleys onto conveyor belts, watching as their groceries disappear behind metal doors to be packed.

Near the checkout area, customers stand in line at the live seafood counter, waiting their turn to order Boston lobsters and fresh oysters, which can be shucked on the spot and served with wedges of lemon on a bed of crushed ice.

Eateries line the perimeter of the store, offering everything from Japanese souffle pancakes and grilled meats to beer-battered fish and chips and Italian pasta.

Alibaba says New Retail strategy is paying off

Launched last week, Habitat is Honestbee’s concept of what future supermarkets could look like and doubles up as an innovation lab for the company to test out integrated online and offline strategies for the future of retail. The concept is somewhat similar to Hema supermarkets in China, operated by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and emblematic of a wider trend whereby Southeast Asian companies are increasingly looking towards China for internet and technology innovations to drive their business models into the future.

The similarities between Habitat and Hema are quite obvious: Shop in-store or opt for on-demand delivery? Check. Mobile payments? Check. Buy fresh seafood and have it prepared in-house for a piping hot meal? Check again. However, Southeast Asian companies are also putting their own twist on things.

“Hema did New Retail … and set the stage for that, but we’re trying to evolve it and put our own take on this,” said Pauline Png, vice-president and managing director for Honestbee’s Habitat supermarket.

“We feel that an offline space … is about human interaction and about learning and being inspired and engaging the five senses,” she said, pointing out that the supermarket and dining areas are integrated to give shoppers a better experience. Hema currently separate these sections and Hema still offers manned cashier counters whereas Habitat has automated check-outs only.

The aim is to “inspire more human engagement for a multi-sensory shopping experience”, according to Honestbee, which has dubbed this model of incorporating online and offline shopping for groceries “NewGen Retail” (Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, calls its own model “New Retail”).

The trend of Southeast Asian companies adopting business models proven to work in China – such as Tencent Holdings’ WeChat super-app model, Alibaba’s Taobao e-commerce model and Alipay’s innovation of escrow payments for e-commerce transactions among others – has been dubbed unsurprisingly as “Copy from China”.

This represents a shift from the “Copy to China” experience, whereby a decade ago many Chinese companies adopted the business models of established US technology firms at a time when the world’s most populous country was still developing as a new technology power.

Mobile-first business models, pioneered in China, are becoming popular in Southeast Asia as the region is at a similar stage of internet connectivity to where China was a decade ago, according to Hian Goh, co-founder and partner at Openspace Ventures in Singapore. Both regions have high mobile penetration rates, with large swathes of people going directly online via the mobile internet whereas in the West most people began their online life on computers.

Grab to open up its platform to third party services

“Southeast Asian tech companies feel like they have the capability to learn from Chinese business models because we are a mobile first internet economy,” Goh said.

Other commentators point to the widespread adoption and appeal of consumer technology in Southeast Asia’s emerging markets.

“Many Southeast Asian start-ups look towards the China model as this part of the world is still very consumer technology-driven, and China has already [proved their models work],” said Chua Joo Hock, managing partner at Vertex Ventures, the venture capital arm of Singapore’s Temasek Holdings.

“In a way, yes there is “Copy from China” in companies here, but obviously the market is different … They look at the good things China has done, the kind of margins they should expect, and localise it accordingly,” he said.

For example, Habitat is located in an industrial area and is not that easy to get to. The reason for picking such an area is that it gives Honestbee the space it requires to execute its vision, says Honestbee’s Png. In contrast, Hema supermarkets tend to be located centrally and in malls, making it easy for consumers to access and allowing it to guarantee 30 minute deliveries within a 3km-radius.

To be sure, Asian companies are not the only ones trying to crack the future of retail. In the US, which arguably gave the world internet browsers, messaging services, e-commerce and social media first – e-commerce firm Amazon in 2016 introduced Amazon Go, a partially-automated store that allows shoppers to grab what they need and leave, with Amazon using sensors and camera-tracking technology to determine what items a shopper took, automatically charging their card. But the recent impetus in Southeast Asia is clearly coming from China.

Singapore-based mobile classifieds platform Carousell, which pioneered the “snap, list, sell” model when it comes to selling second-hand items, earlier this year launched CarouPay, a payment system within its app that serves as an escrow service. If a buyer makes payment through CarouPay, the funds are held by the third party until the buyer has received the item, whereupon payment is then released to the seller.

This model is similar to the strategy that Alibaba took with building its e-commerce empire, where it launched Alipay as a payment and escrow service to improve trust between buyers and sellers on its Taobao e-commerce platform. Alipay’s escrow service is widely credited with increasing the popularity of the Chinese e-commerce platform as it created greater confidence between buyers and sellers in China’s generally low-trust society.

CarouPay is currently available only in Carousell’s home market, Singapore, although the company is looking to introduce this feature to the rest of its markets, according to Quek Siu Rui, co-founder and chief executive of Carousell.

Quek said that the idea to implement CarouPay was deduced from a “first principles” approach, as an escrow service solves the fundamental problem of trust between buyers and sellers. “Applying escrow has been around for a while in the peer-to-peer buying and selling process,” he said.

But unlike Alibaba, which developed Alipay as a digital wallet that allows users to store value and use it within the Alibaba ecosystem of services, CarouPay uses US payments system Stripe to process the payments and works with local banks to accept payments via digital wallets such as DBS Paylah and credit or debit cards.

A 26-year-old Singaporean geek turned down US$100m for his app. It was a great call

“Every market has different payment behaviours and our payment systems and support will have to vary from market to market,” said Quek, pointing out that it is not feasible for Carousell to roll out a one-size-fits-all payments system across its seven markets in Asia.

“In Indonesia for example, it’s unlikely that we will be able to work only with credit cards [as payment] as penetration is so low, you’d have to work with multiple wallet players and [facilitate] bank transfers.”

Southeast Asian technology companies in different service areas, such as Grab and Go-Jek, have also looked towards China for inspiration as the two companies expand beyond offering ride-hailing services. They also count Chinese tech companies Didi Chuxing and Meituan-Dianping as shareholders respectively.

Indonesia’s Go-Jek has established itself as a provider of local services in its home market, delivering everything from food, groceries, and parcels. Via the Go-Jek app, users can even shop online and have drivers deliver their online shopping to them, or book massages and movie tickets. Since July this year, Singapore-based Grab has integrated food delivery and on-demand groceries delivery into its app as it seeks to become an “everyday app” for users.

This so-called super-app model, where users are able to access a plethora of services within one main app, was pioneered by Tencent’s WeChat messaging app. From a simple messaging app launched in 2011, the company has evolved to become a must-have app in China, offering not just messaging services but also a social feed, digital wallet and mini-programs that gives users access to everything from addictive mobile games to bike rentals without ever having to exit the WeChat platform.

The WeChat story: how Tencent's super-app changed China

At the end of the day, the best entrepreneurs are those who have a willingness to adapt quickly to the cultural and business practices in different countries across the region, said Openspace’s Goh. Singapore, which has become the de facto start-up hub of the region thanks to strong government support, solid infrastructure and an inflow of venture capital, is also “uniquely positioned” as a base to draw on lessons from both China and Silicon Valley, he said.

And there’s a lot at stake for those looking to drag Southeast Asia into the 21st century. The gross domestic product of Asean, comprising 10 Southeast Asian countries, is about US$2.8 trillion according to data from UOB Group. That is roughly the same size as China’s GDP in 2006, before it embarked on a decade of breakneck growth and innovation.

“We have today’s technology and mobile connectivity transforming a market that feels like China 10 years ago,” said Goh. “My gut feel is that we will take five years to do what took China took a decade to achieve.”"

Money is pouring in and valuations are soaring as investors bet big on the region's rapid growth, huge markets and youthful, mobile-savvy consumers.

With so much at stake, cities from Singapore to Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City are competing to become the next Silicon Valley -- home not only to successful startups but also to the mentors, investors and institutions that support them.

The Nikkei Asian Review looked at criteria ranging from number of startups to cost of office space and selected the five cities below as the hottest places for innovation in Southeast Asia.

In early 2015, Sinuhe Arroyo spotted a chance for his artificial intelligence startup to win a contract with a government agency in Singapore. But his colleagues warned him against it, since their company, Taiger, though based in Singapore, was incorporated in Spain.

Arroyo, the company's founder and chief executive, pressed ahead anyway -- and was pleasantly surprised when Taiger became the first foreign company to win a contract from the Singaporean government.

""My colleagues had opposed ... bidding, saying it would be a waste of time. But I insisted Singapore is such a transparent meritocracy that we have a chance to win a contract if we have a convincing technology. I was right,"" recalls Arroyo.

The Taiger team had moved to Singapore from the U.S. at the end of 2014 because they saw a less-cultivated, more transparent and faster-growing business-tech market in Asia.

In 2016, after receiving two more government tenders, Taiger reincorporated in Singapore. The following year, Singapore's startup-backing agency SGInnovate invested in Taiger in its first fundraising round, alongside local private equity firm Tembusu Partners.

Today Taiger is a darling of Singapore's AI startup scene. Its clients include such global companies as AIA Group, Banco Santander, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Standard Chartered. And Arroyo advises government panels on national AI strategies.

Long established as a financial center, Singapore has become the leading startup hub in Southeast Asia thanks to a mix of ready capital and government policies. According to Enterprise Singapore, the number of startups in the city-state increased from about 2,800 in 2003 to 4,300 in 2016. Venture capital funding jumped from $80 million in 2010 to $1.2 billion in 2017, according to KPMG.

Singaporean venture capitalist Yinglan Tan sees a ""lifetime opportunity"" in his home country. He left Sequoia Capital last year to found his own venture capital firm, Insignia Ventures Partners, based in Singapore.

He sees plenty of room for growth, noting that Southeast Asia's total tech industry market cap is roughly $20 billion, compared to $300 billion in India, where the GDP per capita of $1,700 is less than half of Southeast Asia's $3,800. ""Southeast Asia's tech industry should be at least $100 billion, which presents a huge opportunity for various types of startups and VCs,"" Tan said.

Singapore is attracting global investors who want to use it as a base to invest in Southeast Asia's tech sector, mainly because of the country's rule of law and tax regime, Tan said. It is also attracting entrepreneurs and other talent thanks to its ease of doing businesses, quality of life and high level of education, he added.

""Lots of U.S.-educated fellow Singaporeans are coming back,"" Tan said. Some nonnative entrepreneurs like Arroyo, a Spanish citizen, are choosing Singapore as the place for incorporation as well.

As a Sequoia partner, Tan lived in Silicon Valley, which has thrived with an ecosystem of angel investors, entrepreneurs-turned-mentors, venture capitalists, lawyers and banks. He says that Singapore is rapidly developing those supporting functions as well. ""Five years ago there was almost none of those. Now we see a critical mass of mentors and supporters,"" Tan said.

Taiger CEO and founder Sinuhe Arroyo says foreign businesses can flourish in Singapore if they have a ""convincing technology."" (Photo by Akira Kodaka)

One of those crucial elements is incubation space. The Singaporean government has been proactive in fostering this aspect as well.

In 2011 the National University of Singapore launched a startup-incubation space called Block 71 in a renovated industrial building. Taking its name from its street address, Block 71 adopted a similar strategy as 500 Startups, the pioneering incubator launched a year earlier in Silicon Valley.

Today Block 71 is a cluster of seven incubation buildings set on a 16,000-sq.-meter piece of land. It hosts 250 startups and 30 incubators and VCs -- making it one of the largest clusters of startups in the world.

Michael Yap, a Block 71-based venture capitalist who worked in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's office when Block 71 was launched, says Singaporeans still need to ""think harder"" about how the city-state should adapt to change.

For example, if Indonesia -- the region's largest economy and home to four ""unicorns"" -- accelerates reforms and becomes more business-friendly, it is unclear whether Singapore could maintain its advantage as a regional hub for entrepreneurs and investors.

""We should think about what roles we can play in different environments so that people would not forget about Singapore and jump to Indonesia,"" Yap said.

Indonesia's capital may not be the easiest place to do business -- the city is plagued by chronic traffic jams, and there is plenty of red tape. But despite the hassles, Jakarta has recently become one of Southeast Asia's most exciting startup hubs.

Indonesia boasts four unicorns -- startups valued at $1 billion or more -- and it is the second-largest recipient of venture capital in Southeast Asia, behind only Singapore. Venture capital firms pumped $1.4 billion into 123 deals in 2016, double the value of their commitments a year earlier, according to consultancy AT Kearney and Google. Deal values more than likely doubled again in 2017.

""Now we are seeing a much more consistent rise of startups,"" said Ridzki Syahputera, corporate development manager at Convergence Ventures, a local venture capital firm. ""I think a lot of it is market confidence that they will get funding. Entrepreneurs believe that they can get funding, whereas five years ago, they might have thought, only if I am really the best would I be able to successfully fundraise.""

It is Indonesia's market potential that has international investors excited. The country has the world's fourth-largest population, of over 260 million people, 60% of whom are under 40. They are also digital-savvy: Smartphone penetration is set to reach 78% in 2020.

Unlike countries with smaller domestic markets like Singapore or South Korea, Indonesia's startup scene is focused on the consumer sector. Its unicorns are all consumer-centric: Tokopedia and Bukalapak are e-commerce companies, while Go-Jek started off as a ride-hailing app and is now a platform for ordering a variety of daily services. Traveloka is an online travel service.

The next wave of startups has focused on ancillary services like payments, logistics and advertising technology. And while the shallowness of Indonesia's capital markets means that an IPO exit strategy is unfeasible for most startups, the country's unicorns are now acting as acquirers of these new businesses -- further invigorating the ecosystem in the nation's capital.

President Joko Widodo's push to make Indonesia the biggest digital economy in the region has contributed to the momentum. His administration is backing an initiative to foster 1,000 startups by 2020 with a total valuation of $10 billion, and it plays a key role in the Nexticorn program, which brings together promising local startups with international investors to help with latter-stage funding.

In 2017 Widodo ordered the relevant ministries to support startups, including by offering grants to incubators. His administration also made it easier for e-commerce companies to receive low-rate bank loans and provided simplified tax procedures for those with annual turnover below 4.8 billion rupiah.

""I am pretty content with what is happening, how Jakarta is developing as a city,"" said Benedicto Haryono, co-founder and CEO of the online P2P lending service KoinWorks. Founded in 2015, it is one of the many fintech startups that are springing up in the city.

But he added that problems remain. ""Hiring is still a challenge. [There is a] lack of talent, the talent pool is so small,"" Haryono said. ""If you have money, yes you can hire, but if you have to compete with the likes of Go-Jek on hiring, it is difficult.""

This issue is ""not easy to fix overnight,"" said Shekhar Chauhan, principal at AT Kearney. According to the consultancy, Indonesia produces only 278 engineers per 1 million people each year, far behind regional peers like Malaysia or Thailand, which produce well over a thousand.

""One of the recommendations we had was facilitating, getting in more foreign talent, which is another issue in Indonesia,"" Chauhan said. Indonesia is wary of bringing in skilled foreign labor, as it may hamper job opportunities for its young workforce.

The combination of large amounts of money chasing startups without enough talent is raising some concern among investors, he added.

""That is where they might hit roadblocks,"" Chauhan said.

The charms of Bangkok that have long attracted holiday goers are increasingly appealing to multinational entrepreneurs wanting to set up shop in Asia. Developed infrastructure, good access to neighboring markets, affordable prices and sunny weather are only a handful of the reasons why startups are sprouting in the Thai capital.

German-born Michael Cluzel, co-founder and group CEO of restaurant booking app operator Eatigo, chose Bangkok for its headquarters and the app's debut market because of its high mobile internet penetration rate and less competitive environment compared to advanced Western economies.

Eatigo offers diners time-based discounts -- deals are better during off-peak hours -- so that eateries can fill up their empty tables. Cluzel got the idea from how airplanes and hotels change their rates depending on availability.

""Nobody in the world had ever done such an app for restaurants before so we needed to invent a new playbook,"" Cluzel told the Nikkei Asian Review. ""We didn't want to do it through a looking glass in New York or San Francisco -- we wanted to be in a market where we can learn, and Asia was just right.""

Bangkok was a good fit for Eatigo, with its population of 8.2 million, rising middle class, few restaurant app rivals, strong dining culture and -- perhaps above all -- discount-loving consumers.

Cluzel and his three co-founders also saw Bangkok as a springboard to other Asian markets.

""If it works here, we thought it is going to work in Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta,"" he said, citing similarities such as the culture of dining out and expanding middle-income consumers.

After launching in Bangkok in 2014, the app is now in six countries, including in competitive markets like Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, Singapore and Hong Kong -- and has grabbed the leading share in many of them.

Multinational startups like Eatigo are not unusual in Bangkok. Japanese entrepreneur Yojiro Koshi picked Bangkok as the base for TalentEx, which offers human resource-related services, in part because he liked its mix of urban development and livability.

""Bangkok was livable for my family, compared to Singapore, which would be too expensive, or Jakarta, which still lacks a lot of basic infrastructure like public transportation,"" he said. Bangkok also has a large base of Japanese corporations that could be his potential clients.

Rising government support is set to draw more startups to Thailand, especially Bangkok. The military junta has positioned startups as a crucial player in its ""Thailand 4.0"" policy, which aims to shift the nation's industries from labor-intensive to tech-oriented and knowledge-based.

One obstacle facing entrepreneurs launching a startup in Thailand is the 49% foreign ownership cap, which restricts them from receiving funds from foreign venture capital firms, and a range of business fields that are off-limits to foreigners unless they have a Thai co-founder.

But three government policies -- the Thailand Startup Act, Regulatory Sandbox Act and Thai Bayh-Dole Act -- are in the works that could ease some of these restrictions. A clause in the draft of the Thailand Startup Act, for example, would allow startups to be 100% foreign-owned. The new rules are expected to be enacted before the next general election, which could come as early as February 2019.

Funding opportunities are growing, too. Thai startups raised at least $100 million in 2017, a more than tenfold increase from 2013, according to startup website Techsauce. Thai corporations and state-owned enterprises have launched a slew of venture capital firms and accelerator programs in the past year or two. And in May, the Stock Exchange of Thailand launched a crowdfunding platform for startups and small and midsize enterprises to source funding from institutional investors and venture capitals.

Foreign capital is also flowing in. In late 2017, Bangkok-based online fashion brand Pomelo Fashion raised $19 million in a series B round led by Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com and Indonesian investment firm Provident Capital Partners. Japan's leading online fashion company Start Today (since renamed Zozo) also joined the round. It was reportedly the largest series B fundraising in Thailand at that time.

""Our investors have created so many new opportunities for our Thai company,"" said David Jou, the Korean-American co-founder of Pomelo. The fast-fashion brand focuses primarily on Asian markets. Its designers are all hired locally to fit local tastes, and their price points are about half those of Western fashion brands like Zara and H&M.

JD has listed Pomelo's clothes on its websites in Thailand and Indonesia and might pave the way for Pomelo to venture into the Chinese market, Jou said. The fact that it is a Thai company might help: Thailand is the No. 1 destination for Chinese travelers, and its food is popular in China.

""Being a Thai company,"" Jou said, ""is an opportunity for us.""

Drone startup Poladrone is one of Penang's homegrown success stories. (Photo by Akira Kodaka)

There is no doubt that Malaysia's most famous startup is the one that got away. Two years after Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling launched the MyTeksi ride-hailing app in Malaysia, the company -- by then renamed Grab -- relocated its headquarters to neighboring Singapore. Since that move in 2014, Grab has become a $10 billion company and taken over Uber's Southeast Asia business.

But Ashran Ghazi, who runs the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre, or MaGIC, says he is not dwelling on the past. His agency, which was set up in 2014 to raise the country's next generation of entrepreneurs, is focused on building ""awesome companies,"" he said. Keeping successful startups in Malaysia is not a primary consideration, he added.

There is no shortage of entrepreneurs in the country, many of whom are congregating in the northern island of Penang. Among them is Ai Ching Goh, who gave up her marketing job at Procter & Gamble to establish Piktochart, a visual communications app that makes it easier for nondesigners to create infographics. Founded in 2012 Piktochart boasts over 13 million registered users -- about half of whom are in North America.

""We are not just a design-tool app per se but one that allows users to tell a better story through charts,"" said 32-year-old Goh, who has about 60 employees representing 15 nationalities.

The company's app is aimed at anyone from students to small and midsize businesses.

Penang has long been home to multinational companies, including chipmaking giant Intel, which fostered a strong engineering workforce. The state government is pushing harder to encourage entrepreneurship, a job that should be easier since the national elections in May. Penang was under opposition rule for a decade, which meant it received little aid for development from the federal government.

""It is pivotal to show that it's possible for a company based in Penang to become a global company,"" said Howie Chang of aCAT, an agency launched in 2015 to promote entrepreneurship.

Among Penang's homegrown engineers is 26-year-old Jin Xi Cheong, who left Intel to start Poladrone, a drone startup that launched in 2016 with guidance from aCat.

The company uses drones to take high-resolution photographs for technical analysis in the agriculture and oil and gas sectors. Now based near Kuala Lumpur, Poladrone counts Malaysia's leading palm oil companies like Sime Darby Plantation as its customers. Its services include measuring tree density for fertilizer forecasts and disease detection -- jobs that had to be done manually before.

Plantation owners in neighboring Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam have knocked on Poladrone's door for solutions, said Cheong, adding that he is considering expanding abroad.

Another Penang startup is EasyParcel, an online parcel delivery operator that has tied up with over 10 couriers, including DHL and FedEx. After four years in operation, EasyParcel has over 400,000 users in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, earning a margin from the bulk discount provided by the couriers.

Most of these startups share a common feature: government support of some kind, especially funding. The Cradle Fund is one of the government agencies that has been nurturing startups since 2003, disbursing grants of between 25,000 ringgit ($6,012) and 800,000 ringgit.

The fund, which has backed over 700 tech-based startups, has also become a source of venture capital. With a targeted investment size of between 1 million ringgit and 3 million ringgit per company, its wholly owned unit Cradle Seed Ventures takes minority equity stakes of not more than 25% in companies that are involved in mobile technology, software and enterprise solutions, and hardware engineering.

To keep up with global trends, the fund is on the lookout for companies active in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.

Dzuleira Abu Bakar, Cradle Seed Ventures chief executive, however, says the idea is not simply to copy other markets.

""I believe each country moves at its own pace given the market dynamics, readiness of talent, infrastructure and other economic variables -- not so much the catch-up game but more of moving in the direction of where technology trends are headed towards.""

When e-commerce platform Sendo raised $50 million this year from SoftBank and other foreign investors, it was a reflection of two trends in Vietnam: booming online sales and rising interest in one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.

As an e-commerce platform for individuals and small businesses to sell their goods, Sendo has benefited from strong annual online sales growth of 30% in Vietnam in recent years. That high growth rate is expected to continue at least through 2020, according to the Vietnam E-commerce Association.

Nguyen Dac Viet Dung, Sendo's chairman, says he plans to raise more money to keep growing. ""We [will] seek one or two more rounds of fundraising in the next five years,"" he told Nikkei in a recent interview.

Vietnam's startup environment is less well-developed than regional rivals like Singapore or Indonesia, but the central government is aiming to change that. It has set up three main high-tech parks in Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City, and it is creating incentives for the development of new high-tech businesses -- including the planned launch of an $85 million startup fund this year.

Ho Chi Minh City has kicked off construction of an incubator for local tech startups inside the Saigon Hi-Tech Park, already home to tech giants such as Intel and Samsung. The facility will cover an area of over 11,000 sq. meters, and officials say the city has spent $90 million for startup and innovation programs there in the past two years.

Vietnam does not keep statistics on startups, but pan-Asia consultancy Dezan Shira & Associates says $290 million was invested in 92 Vietnamese startups in 2017. According to tech news site Techsauce, there were about 3,000 startups operating in the country last year.

Investment is coming from inside and outside Vietnam. Tiki, another e-commerce platform, raised $54 million from China's JD.com this year, following $17 million from internet company VNG in 2016 and an undisclosed amount from CyberAgent Ventures, Seedcom and Sumitomo. Momo, an e-wallet and payments app, received $28 million from Standard Chartered Private Equity and Goldman Sachs in 2016.

IDG Ventures Vietnam was the first venture capital firm to focus on technology startups in the country when it launched in 2004. The fund manages $100 million and has invested in some 40 startups in the fields of technology, media and consumer industries. This year, VinaCapital, an investment fund that manages $1.8 billion in assets, launched the $100 million VinaCapital Ventures VC fund, one of the biggest local funds for startups. In all, there are some 70 venture capital funds operating in Vietnam, more than two-thirds of them from overseas.

Much of the tech startup activity in Vietnam centers on blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies -- despite the fact that the country has yet to craft a regulatory framework for those industries following a series of scandals.

In April, Vietnam was at the center of the biggest fraud in cryptocurrency history, where investors said they were robbed of as much as $660 million through scams linked to initial coin offerings. The government has since taken a hard line on the industry.

But many companies remain bullish on the opportunity for blockchain-related businesses in Vietnam -- including Nami Corp. The company is developing AI and blockchain technologies for its financial investment ecosystem and products for managing financial services.

""Vietnam lacks a legal framework for crypto and related technologies, which means people are often confused when we talk about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain,"" said Giap Van Dai, the 27-year-old co-founder of Nami. ""It should take four or five more years before the blockchain technique can be applied in local business communities, since it will take time for the market to accept it and for authorities to come up with related regulations.""

According to Dai, the blockchain industry in Vietnam employs around 2,000 people, up from 30 in 2017. Many of them graduated overseas and gained experience developing apps, financial services and other products in developed countries, including in the U.S., Japan and Singapore.

""Young people are enthusiastic to learn and work in the new industry,"" Dai said."

Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Financial technology (Fintech) companies in Indonesia are committed to supporting the government`s programs to increase financial inclusion to 75 percent in 2019.



Fintech companies that target retails and micro transactions in a number of provinces in Indonesia will expand people`s reach to have financial access.



Aidil Zulkifli, the CEO and Co-founder of UangTeman, a fintech company, said in a statement received by Antara here on Wednesday that people nowadays are beginning to utilize fintech services to meet their business needs.



""As one of the fintech companies, UangTeman continues to be committed to supporting the government in its efforts to enhance financial inclusion in Indonesia. This commitment is showed in a socialization program that we continue to carry out.""



""Last week, for instance, we held some socialization programs in five cities in Indonesia, collaborated with an online motorbikes transportation company,"" Zulkifli noted.



He said that through socialization and close attachment with people, fintech services, especially peer-to-peer (P2P) lending can be properly used, thus bringing about a positive influence on customers and contributing to the national economy.



The Financial Services Authority (OJK) has up to July 2018 recorded a total distribution of fintech loans worth Rp9.21 trillion (about US$606 million), or an increase by 259.36 percent (ytd), with an NPL worth 1.4 percent.



The number of Fintech P2P Lending fund provider accounts was 135,025 entities, or an increase by 33.77 percent (ytd), while the number of borrower accounts was 1,430,357 entities, or an increase by 450.91 percent (ytd).



As of Sept 4, 2018, the number of Fintech P2P Lending companies which registered in OJK was 67.



Meanwhile, there were 40 companies in the registration process and 38 companies that were interested in registering at OJK.



The government, through OJK, expects financial inclusion in 2019 to reach 75 percent, or an increase by 69 percent from that in 2017.



Based on the 2017 National Financial Inclusion Strategy (SNKI) Revisit, the public financial literacy index showed that only 13 of 34 provinces have a financial literacy index above the national average.



This condition reflects the uneven public knowledge about finance in all provinces.



Such dissimilarity is also seen in the amount of fintech loans as of July 2018, valued at Rp9.21 trillion, which is dominated by people in Java at Rp8.1 trillion. Meanwhile, the remaining fund of Rp1.11 trillion was used by those outside Java.



Chairman of Aftech`s Cash Loan P2P, Sunu Widyatmoko, remarked that the financial inclusion target of 75 percent in 2019 is an opportunity for fintech businesses to contribute to the national program.



According to him, the performance of Fintech P2P Lending can make the financial inclusion target set by the government more possible to materialize in 2019.



""Fintech, especially P2P Lending Cash Loan, is aimed at facilitating prospective customers to access financial services, especially for those who have difficulty obtaining capital or lack of access to banks,"" Widyatmoko revealed.



He is optimistic Fintech P2P Lending can contribute to achieve the financial inclusion target of 75 percent in 2019.



""We are optimistic that the 75 percent target will be achieved. So far our performance has been good. People increasingly trust fintech. We do not find obstacles in terms of regulation, administration, or other things,"" he pointed out.

However, since Indian weddings have become such a popular target for uninvited guests, a new Indian startup has decided to cash in on the phenomenon by selling admission tickets to traditional Indian weddings to tourists.

As reported by Travel+Leisure, Join My Wedding allows Indian couples who are open to the idea of pocketing some extra cash and new friends.

“Experiencing all the cultural elements at once, meaningfully connecting with the locals in India, that’s a huge motivating factor for the travelers,” said Join My Wedding CEO Orsi Parkanyi as quoted by CNBC.

The service is said to link hosts and guests prior to the main event, so that when the wedding comes, the bride and groom won’t be suddenly accepting complete strangers into their sacred circle.

“It’s a safe experience,” Parkanyi added. “You attend an event with hundreds of people, you’re a distinguished guest, people look after you.""

The startup has sold tickets to more than 100 weddings across India thus far. Ticket prices also depend on what kind of event you have decided to attend, and these events can be for a single day or two to three days. Single-day attendance tends to price around US$150, while two to three day events tend to price around $250. (acr/kes)"
11;795835774;20181019;2018;https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Startups-in-Asia/India-s-Oyo-aims-to-disrupt-global-hotel-industry;"GURGAON, India -- Ritesh Agarwal was born to be an entrepreneur.

The 24-year-old founder of Oyo Hotels was in elementary school when he started computer programming. Today, his app-based hotel chain is India's largest, and he is now preparing to expand into Europe and the Middle East following huge growth in his home country and China.

Agarwal was 13 when he started his ""first business in life"" -- selling mobile-phone SIM cards and fast-moving consumer goods on the street in his small hometown in the eastern state of Odisha.

A year later, he declared to his middle-school classmates that he wanted to become an entrepreneur, even though he had not yet fully comprehended its meaning. ""If you want to be the cool kid in the class, you say something nobody else understands,"" Agarwal told the Nikkei Asian Review.

Digging up the definition in a dictionary, he read that an entrepreneur is ""somebody who solves a problem and creates a business in the process.""

The problem he set out to solve presented itself when Agarwal was just 19. He realized that almost none of the world's major hotel chains run properties with fewer than 100 rooms, but more than 90% of hotels fall into that category -- and he saw big potential in that huge under-cultivated inventory.

""Nobody had ever tried,"" he said. ""So I decided to tackle that segment, thinking to myself that an entrepreneur would take a 5% chance.""

Oyo, which is owned and operated by parent company Oravel Stays and based near Delhi in Gurgaon, was founded in 2013 by Agarwal, who turns 25 next month. Since then, it has become India's largest hotel chain by number of rooms and enterprise value, or market value plus net debt.

When the company secured $1 billion in venture capital funding in September from the existing shareholders -- including SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners -- it valued the company at about $5 billion. That is more than twice as big as India's largest publicly traded hotel operator, Indian Hotels, owner of the upmarket Taj hotels, whose market cap was roughly $2 billion as of Oct. 19. After the latest funding round, Agarwal is estimated to hold less than 10% of Oyo.

The business strategy is based on the fairly simple principle of bringing common standards and processes to the highly diverse small budget hotel sector. Run by individuals and families, these hotels have been largely underdeveloped and ignored by major chains. But Agarwal is offering these independent hoteliers the opportunity to benefit from the economies of scale that these big hotel operators enjoy by joining his rapidly growing Oyo franchise.

""Once joining the Oyo chain, room quality and service quality both improve while prices go down because of better efficiency,"" Agarwal said, adding that the occupancy rate of a small budget hotel in India typically increases from around 25% to 65%-70% within a month after joining. Room rates typically range from $25 to $50 a night. The lowest-price-range brands of global majors normally price their rooms above $50. In return Oyo receives franchise fees or a share of revenue.

Establishing that business model with the first Oyo hotel took almost two years, during which time Agarwal spent nearly a year in Silicon Valley on a fellowship grant from Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook.

The number of rooms in India under Oyo's inventory management soared in the two years ending June 2018, from 1,000 to 100,000. (Photo by Akira Kodaka)

During his stay in California, Agarwal met many entrepreneurs, including Thiel, and ""learned two things,"" he said. ""One is that being innovative is OK, and the second is to think big.""

""In India, many people say you should copy American success models to be successful in India. Also in India, you are taught to think just enough,"" he explained. ""In California, I realized it is OK to try original models, and I should be thinking global rather than just India.""

After returning to India from California in 2014, Oyo's explosion began.

The number of rooms in India under Oyo's management soared in the two years ending June 2018, from 1,000 to 100,000. The company then added another 33,000 rooms during the third quarter of this year.

Meanwhile, since entering the Chinese market in November 2017, its room inventory there reached 129,000 by the end of September. That pushed Oyo into the top 10 ranking in terms of room inventory in China, putting it on track to surpass its home market in India in the near future.

Worldwide, Oyo added roughly 140,000 rooms to its network during the quarter ended September. That far outstrips Marriott International, the world's biggest hotel operator, which added a little over 20,000 rooms in the quarter ended June.

Marriott still had a far bigger global room inventory at 1.28 million by June this year. Oyo, by comparison, had an inventory of just 270,000 rooms as of last month, spanning operations in India, China, Nepal, Malaysia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K.

But, with growth accelerating both in India and China, and ambitious expansion plans for the U.K., the UAE and Indonesia, Oyo's expansion is likely to continue at a breakneck pace. It could even overtake Marriott by room number sometime in the near future.

Oyo is looking at other growth opportunities in the rest of Southeast Asia and continental Europe.

Oyo's secret for such rapid growth is in part due to the fact that it is not yet going head to head with global hotel giants. But it is also thanks to its innovative approach. The company has brought a ""completely new model of running a hotel,"" Masayoshi Son, founder and chief executive of SoftBank Group, Oyo's largest shareholder, noted in August at a news conference in Tokyo.

Oyo's success can be seen in the sharp increase in revenue reported in its annual accounts. Consolidated revenue was declared at $19 million for the year to end of March 2017. Agarwal says revenue for the rest of calendar 2017 was growing at 130% over the previous year and in 2018 it is up by between 200% and 300% on last year.

But the company's fast growth comes with some risks. A market-research analyst has warned that at Oyo's pace of growth, ""their organization can easily be overstretched, which may drag facility and service quality down and damage their brand.""

Agarwal says that Oyo has established a virtuous cycle of very rapid organic self-growth driven by individual investors and hoteliers by instantly providing them with comprehensive support thanks to innovative technology and a high degree of human organization.

""We forward-invest in our capacity building,"" he said, in contrast to major hotel operators, which typically invest following demand.

Oyo employs about 700 software engineers out of a total 8,500-strong workforce. This engineering team releases about 20 new pieces of software every day, including new mobile apps and updated versions of existing apps.

One of the company's most effective apps, dubbed ORBIS, instantly calculates a hotel's projected occupancy rates and revenue after joining Oyo by analyzing ""hundreds of thousands of items of data in that particular local lodging market,"" Agarwal said.

Traditional hotel chains typically take 10 or 11 months to sign a franchise or management-contract deal with a property owner, he said. ""At a major chain, a negotiator needs to call his city boss, and then the city boss calls the country boss, and the country boss calls the regional boss, and so on,"" he said. ""At Oyo, ORBIS on his mobile phone is the boss.""

The app calculates all the risks involved in a deal and makes a decision on whether to approve it. ""It is data science,"" Agarwal said. ""We typically sign a deal 10 days after the first meeting with a property owner.""

After signing a deal and renovating rooms, the hotel owner can run his hotel by using dedicated mobile apps, which handle everything from inventory management to bookkeeping to housekeeping.

The company also has an army of workers to convert existing rooms and buildings into Oyo branded ones. ""We have 700 civil and construction engineers working 24/7 in India and China to make sure renovation and construction works are completely under our control,"" Agarwal said.

Agarwal says he learned two things while on a fellowship in Silicon Valley a few years ago: ""One is that being innovative is OK, and the second is to think big."" (Photo by Akira Kodaka)

The booking software behind the website analyzes large amounts of real-time data and continually calculates the demand-supply situation. It resets room rates in a given area millions of times a day to optimize occupancy. At the same time, a few thousand sales people make bulk deals with local businesses. With that combination of technology and human power, Oyo says it is able to boost occupancy rates for new member hotels within weeks.

While small budget hotels have given him his start, Agarwal has now begun experimenting in the slightly higher value end of the hotel industry. Last year, the company launched Oyo Townhouse, whose room rates range from $30 to $70 and which targets business travelers with meeting spaces and other amenities. But instead of bringing independent middle market hotels under Oyo's umbrella, the company directly manages properties.

Indian consultancy RedSeer said in a recent report that Oyo Townhouse's room inventory growth is three times as fast as existing chains in the Indian middle-segment hotel market.

Oyo is entering the U.K. in the middle segment with the same format, too, and is aiming to convert unbranded hotels into Oyo Townhouses.

In mid-October, it announced that it was entering a full expansion phase in the UAE and Indonesia. Agarwal said he wants to have around 300 hotels in U.K. by the end of 2019, and 150 in the UAE by 2020. It has already opened 1,000 rooms at 30 hotels in Jakarta, Surabaya and Palembang and plans to expand into 35 cities in Indonesia by late 2019.

If Oyo succeeds in establishing itself in the U.K., he will think about tackling continental European markets, ""one by one.""

Oyo's efforts to penetrate richer markets and higher value segments have already begun. Japan could even be next.

For the company that was established in 2013, the goal is to create a borderless open financial system for everyone. Realizing that global expansion is a key growth driver for businesses around the world but without the readiness of the infrastructure of the financial transactions process, Omise champions to conduct payments anytime and anywhere without borders as a necessity.

With an open platform for everyone, the company believes it will allow global buyers and sellers to meet directly, and conduct global settlements, making payments able to happen anywhere in the world.

The companies will leverage on the OMG Network, eWallet Suite, and OMG DEX, which are all currently under development as tools for businesses to provide opportunity for anyone with a mobile device to easily access fast, fair, and secure instant global payments.

“Today’s announcement with industry leaders like Global Brain, 31VENTURES, and SMDV is another solid step further on our path of developing a new payments infrastructure. We look forward to engaging in broader partnerships and opportunities to tap into Japan’s rapidly evolving market,” said Jun Hasegawa, CEO & Founder of Omise.

The round was joined by Mitsui Fudosan’s corporate venture arm, 31VENTURES, and existing backer Indonesian VC firm Sinar Mas Digital Ventures (SMDV).

Omise said the investors will help it penetrate Japan, Southeast Asia and other high-growth markets.

“This undisclosed funding not only brings in additional financial support, but more importantly, connectivity with strategic partners to strengthen the reach of the financial infrastructure currently in the development phase by entities under Omise Holdings — Omise payments, OmiseGO and GO.Exchange,” noted a company statement.

Founded in 2013, the fintech startup last raised an undisclosed Series B+ round led by Krungsri Finnovate, the CVC arm of Krungsri Bank (Bank of Ayudhya) in September 2017. It secured a $17.5-million Series B round led by SBI Asset Management in 2016, besides raising $25 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) for building an ethereum-based payment network last July. Its market cap crossed $1 billion in August last year, nudging it into unicorn territory.

Omise and Global Brain have partnered with each other on several ongoing foundational projects including the Ethereum Community Fund and a blockchain-focused co-working space, Neutrino. The fintech startup said both parties will continue to progress on these projects.

In December last year, Global Brain and Omise also announced that they will set up a new blockchain-focused fund.

Global Brain started dabbling in the blockchain space three years ago, eventually launching a separate arm, GB Blockchain Labs Corporation (GBBL), last year. The VC, which manages assets worth approximately $1 billion, has invested in blockchain startups such as Coins.ph and Bluzelle.

Last year, Global Brain closed its $180-million sixth fund, its largest since its inception in 2001. The fund, which is currently investing, backs companies offering Internet of Things (IoT), hardware, enterprise, robotics, education and commerce solutions.

The company announced the latest equity financing on Wednesday, which is backed by Danhua Venture Capital, the NEO Foundation and Wu Capital, a China-based family office and limited partner in funds created by investment firms like Sequoia China.

Launched in November 2017, Cobo was founded by Mao Shixing, a.k.a Discus Fish in the Chinese crypto community, and a former Google and Facebook engineer named Jiang Changhao, whose previous crypto wallet startup Bihang was acquired by OKCoin in 2013.

Mao is also an early-stage bitcoin investor who dropped out of college at the age of 23 to found F2Pool in 2013, one of the earliest mining pools in China that now owns about 7 percent of the global bitcoin hash rate.

Cobo, which now has about 60 people on staff, said the wallet service has been able to amass around 500,000 users – 80 percent of whom come from China – since the app went live early this year, thanks to its offering of a staking pool feature.

In addition to cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-work mechanism, the wallet also allows users to store proof-of-stake crypto assets and consolidate them as a pooled force to continue proof-of-stake mining and distribute block rewards to users on a proportional basis.

With the new capital, Cobo is eyeing an expansion of its services to other developing economies as the market in China has entered a ""plateau,"" co-founder and CEO Mao told CoinDesk in an interview.

""We are now looking to recruit more engineers as we target to expand to Southeast Asian markets like Vietnam and Indonesia, as well as African countries,"" he said.

In addition, Liu Lixin, head of hardware at Cobo, said the company is launching Cobo Vault, a wallet product that the company touts to be ""military grade.""

Liu added that Cobo Vault features a self-destruction mechanism, which – upon detection of any physical force of removing the chip that stores private keys – will eliminate all the inside data. After that, users can only regain access to their crypto assets via mnemonic phrases – a set of words that can be translated into private keys.

Liu said the company has started the pre-order of the hardware with shipments scheduled around early December.

The new funding comes after Cobo raised a total of $7 million in a seed round in October and also a pre-A round in December last year, the company said.

Mr Ma told reporters yesterday that he wanted to set up a Jack Ma Institute to train Indonesians on e-commerce and the Internet. He did not say when it would be launched.

""I'm very happy to say that I'm not coming here as the chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group,"" he said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank annual meetings in Bali.

""I am coming as an adviser,"" added Mr Ma, who is an adviser to the Indonesian government on developing the country's e-commerce sector.

Indonesia's digital economy is projected to hit US$130 billion (S$179.1 billion) by 2020, contributing 11 per cent to its gross domestic product, according to an estimate from the Communications and Information Ministry.

While acknowledging that nothing concrete has been tabled, Mr Ma spoke of training 1,000 tech leaders in Indonesia each year for 10 years.

He said he would also invite local entrepreneurs to attend training but did not elaborate.

""This time I am specifically very moved and inspired by the ministers that they focus on talent, because without that, it's always talk,"" Mr Ma said.

""So only when people improve, when people's mind changes, when people's skills improve, then we can enter the digital period,"" he added.

""We think the future of Indonesia depends on education and training. We should look at how we can make young people to not miss the great challenge and opportunity of this digital period,"" Mr Ma said.

Indonesia is a key market for Alibaba, whose cloud computing arm Alibaba Cloud launched a data centre in the country in March.

The company would continue to invest ""not only on e-commerce, but also cloud computing, logistics and...infrastructure"" in Indonesia, he said, while also helping local businesses to grow.

Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in 1999 with 17 others, several of whom were his students. Now considered among the world's pre-eminent tech companies with 66,000 employees, Alibaba has turned the former educator into one of the world's richest individuals. Forbes has put his net worth at US$36.6 billion.

A father of three children, Mr Ma stepped down as the company's CEO in 2013 and began to pay more attention to philanthropy, among other endeavours. In 2014, he set up a charitable trust in China to tackle health and environment issues. He also funnelled funds to support an education project in rural China last year.

Last month, Mr Ma disclosed his plan to step down as Alibaba's executive chairman when he turns 55 next year. In doing so, he is set to follow in the footsteps of Microsoft founder Bill Gates."
20;793995146;20181012;2018;https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Startups-in-Asia/Indonesia-s-Bukalapak-connects-kiosk-shoppers-to-the-web;"TOKYO / JAKARTA -- On a narrow street behind towering office buildings in central Jakarta, Mulyono has been running a small kiosk for the past four years. Until recently, the 31-year-old small-business owner had been procuring his daily supply of goods -- grocery items like instant noodles, coffee sachets, shampoo and soap -- from local distributors. That started to change in June, when a salesman from Indonesian e-commerce startup Bukalapak showed him how to purchase his supplies on its smartphone app.

""Now I buy everything via Bukalapak ... cellphone credits, cigarettes, instant noodles, even sandals,"" said Mulyono, sitting under a sign at his store that reads ""Bukalapak agent."" Like many Indonesians, Mulyono goes by one name. ""Everything is cheaper, and the delivery is free."" He even receives cash back for buying the goods through the app's electronic payment service and penalty payments if the morning order does not arrive by the end of the day.

Bukalapak has grown by building an online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, jostling for market share with Tokopedia of Indonesia, China's JD.com and others for a slice of Southeast Asia's largest consumer market. But since last year, it has also started to go beyond individual shoppers and target small kiosk owners like Mulyono, by buying products directly from consumer goods companies such as Unilever and distributing them.

By doing so, it hopes to cut out the various layers of middlemen that have kept prices of goods high and incomes for merchants suppressed. That will enable Bukalapak to indirectly reach the tens of millions of consumers that still shop at their neighborhood kiosks for basic goods.

The initiative presents a potential opportunity for navigating Indonesia's challenging e-commerce sector, where a lack of infrastructure, internet connection and banking services have posed major obstacles for startups trying to bring shoppers and merchants online. It is also a sign of how massive investment into the industry is pushing startups to explore unconventional ways of growing.

Achmad Zaky, CEO of online marketplace Bukalapak, during an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review in Tokyo last month. He says the company employs a ""cockroach"" mentality: Instead of taking big-name competitors head on, it has looked for ways to survive on a small budget. (Photo by Ken Kobayashi)

""We are building a network of mom-and-pop stores because they are focusing on the bottom of the pyramid,"" said Achmad Zaky, Bukalapak's founder and chief executive. He said the company has signed up 300,000 kiosk owners across the country and accounts for a ""big"" portion of its annual gross merchandise value, or the value of merchandise sold on the platform.

Overall, Bukalapak says it has four million merchants, over 50 million users, and a gross merchandise value of nearly $4 billion -- larger than Mercari, Japan's leading marketplace app. Bukalapak does not disclose revenue or profit figures, but it is widely considered among industry observers to be loss-making.

Bukalapak has a long way to go: Indonesia is estimated to have millions of kiosks across the archipelago. But investors are already excited.

Zaky said investors poured some $400 million into the company last year in exchange for minority stakes. These investors included Jack Ma's Ant Financial Services Group, the privately held affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding; Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC; Indonesian media conglomerate Elang Mahkota Teknologi, or Emtek Group; and China's New Hope among others. According to Crunchbase, Bukalapak has since become Indonesia's newest unicorn, a private startup valued at $1 billion or more. Zaky said the company is in discussions with more investors for further funding, although he declined to name them.

Joining the big leagues marks an unlikely success for Zaky, 32, who was raised in a small city near Indonesian President Joko Widodo's hometown of Surakarta in Central Java. After studying engineering from Indonesia's elite Bandung Institute of Technology, he and two of his classmates founded Bukalapak, which means ""open stall"" in Bahasa Indonesia, the local language, in 2010 with the aim to empower the country's millions of small businesses through technology.

It was still early days of e-commerce, and Zaky had difficulty convincing merchants about the benefits of selling goods online. Only about one in 20 signed up to join his site, and for the ones who did, he occasionally had to create email addresses and passwords for them. But the efforts soon paid off: Bukalapak received seed funding from a Japanese-Indonesian venture capital fund. That enabled Zaky to hire new talent and scale the business.

The company was ill-equipped, however, to face a flood of competitors flush with cash. Its deep-pocketed rivals included Lazada, the Rocket Internet-backed venture that was bought by Alibaba in 2016.

""Our rival had $1 billion, and we had $1 million,"" Zaky said, recalling how he frequently woke up in the middle of the night, terrified that his startup would shut down the next day.

Bukalapak dealt with the challenge by employing what Zaky calls a ""cockroach"" mentality: Instead of taking the competition head on, it looked for ways to survive even on a small budget.

That led to some outside-the-box ideas. After discovering a strong following among collectors of bicycles and cameras, the company expanded the number of offerings in those hobby-related categories as well as its geographical footprint, working with third party distributors to deliver goods to remote areas like the easternmost province of Papua. It also monetized male shoppers by recommending clothing items for their wives. Zaky's wife is Diajeng Lestari, CEO of Muslim fashion site Hijup.

The push into offline retail represents the company's latest tactic to differentiate itself from competitors.

Indonesia boasts the world's fourth largest population, at 260 million, with a rising middle class and tech-savvy millennials. Google and Temasek Holdings, the Singapore state investment fund, estimate that Indonesia will account for about half of Southeast Asia's $88 billion e-commerce market by 2025. In the conventional online shopping business, Bukalapak jostles for market share with Lazada, JD.com, Tokopedia -- another homegrown unicorn backed by Alibaba -- and scores of players backed by local conglomerates.

Growth is strained, however, by the fact that large numbers of online shoppers are still limited to big cities. Various obstacles still prevent consumers in remote regions from shopping online: There is a chronic shortage of physical and digital infrastructure, and many people do not have the bank accounts necessary to pay for items.

While half of Indonesians are now connected to the Internet, according to London-based marketing company We Are Social, Zaky says only one in 10 actually shop online.

Analysts see the so-called online-to-offline business, or O2O, as a new frontier.

Go-Jek, an Indonesian ride-hailing app, made its food delivery service extremely popular by enabling users to order inexpensive dishes from tens of thousands of street vendors. Traditional channels like kiosks, known locally as warung and kelontong, still represent more than 80% of Indonesia's $120 billion grocery retail market, according to research company Euromonitor.

""The perception that the warung will be replaced by modern convenience stores is wrong,"" said Elisa Suteja, a Jakarta-based analyst at venture capital company East Ventures. ""Indonesians are very social and build personal connections with warung owners. That is why some companies are putting technology in more traditional markets, instead of trying to move transactions online,"" she said.

Zaky said Bukalapak is the first major player to create a network of kiosks. He also has greater ambitions: By amassing data on the transactions of small business owners, Bukalapak aims to create a scoring system and give them small loans.

Bukalapak itself does not have a banking license. After its electronic payment service BukaDompet was suspended in October 2017 pending review by the central bank, it has integrated Dana, which was developed by Ant Financial and Emtek, as a payment channel since August.

Zaky said he is considering expanding its financial-services business further by acquiring such companies that already operate under a license. ""Payment and finance is a very interesting space.""

But questions linger over whether Bukalapak can maintain its edge in an environment where growth is prioritized over profitability. Bukalapak's rivals are similarly looking for new areas to expand into because ""e-commerce is one of the more mature industries,"" Suteja said. Kiosk businesses, which are run under partnerships with third-party logistic providers, are vulnerable to copycats.

Suteja adds that investors are closely watching a new generation of ""vertical"" startups that run leaner, niche e-commerce businesses like coffee or cosmetics. These may eventually take a bite out of ""horizontal"" marketplaces like Bukalapak, which offer a wide range of goods and services.

But Zaky is used to the pressure. ""It's a matter of how strong you are,"" he said. ""Only time will tell."""

At the Commonwealth Central Bank Governors meeting held this week in Bali, Indonesia, Commonwealth experts outlined plans for a toolkit on financial innovation, also known as ‘Fintech’. The aim is to embrace the rapid pace of Fintech, while ensuring it is properly regulated in member states.

The package will include model laws on cybersecurity and bankruptcy, amongst others, which countries can tailor to their specific needs. A Commonwealth regulators’ directory to support collaboration across agencies, as well as tactics to attract investment for innovators are also planned.

The Governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Timothy Antoine, opened the meeting. He described the rise of new technology such as smartphone banking apps, peer-to-peer lending, digital wallets, crowd funding, and crypto-assets as “breath-taking”.

“Central banks ought to be both responsible and responsive, cognisant that the adoption speed of Fintech and its appropriate regulation will, to large extent, depend on the response of regulators like ourselves,” he told participants. “To that end, central banks should choose to lean in and help shape the orderly development of Fintech rather than lean back and adopt a wait and see attitude.”

Delegates from Kenya, Jamaica, eSwatini and the Eastern Caribbean States shared country experiences with Fintech, citing concerns about cybersecurity and data protection, limited internet access, and lack of expertise in tackling various risks.

“We support the toolkit, particularly because we have ventured into an area that we do not know so much about,” said the Governor of the Central Bank of eSwatini, Majozi V. Sithole. “If [a country] has learned something or can come up with successful lessons, it would be good to be shared.”

“We have problems with regulation, [faced] by all the countries. We can sit together and have contributions on this from all the countries – it will be important to build one model,” added the Head of International Relations at the Central Bank of Mozambique, Elsa Chambal.

The Head of the Small States Office at the Commonwealth, Travis Mitchell, welcomed the outcome of the discussions. He said the next step is to secure resources to create a robust toolkit that responds to the needs of member countries.

The outcome of the discussions will feed into the Commonwealth Finance Ministers’ Meeting on 11 October."

Spire was honored to participate in the second webinar series organized by Global Supply Chain Council (GSCC) as a guest speaker. The webinar was held on 20 December, 2017 in Hong Kong. Jeffrey Bahar, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Spire Research and Consulting group shared his insights on cross-border e-commerce challenges and trends for payment and logistics transactions across Southeast Asia.

In his presentation, Bahar shared his insights on potential of cross-border e-commerce transactions in South-East Asia, with a focus on challenges involving payment and logistics issues.

Bahar mentioned that the e-commerce market represents potential for growth due to the rise in internet users across ASEAN-6 countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines) as of 2016. Product purchases (in millions) were highest for Vietnam (33.26), the Philippines (30.34) and Indonesia (24.74) with clothing, accessories as well as footwear amongst the top 5 products purchased.

Cross-border e-commerce market transactions in ASEAN-6 countries account for a projected 37.58% growth (from 2018-2019); higher than the forecasted global average. Despite projected growth, challenges remain. These include customs clearance issues, expensive international shipping, poor transport infrastructure, warehouse readiness, the lack of a single payment system, insufficient clarity on returns policies, delivery process or payment procedure, to name a few.

Nonetheless, some methods can be adopted to overcome these hurdles such as a single integrated platform to simplify international transactions, reduce shipping cost by increasing number of local transhipment warehouses as well as greater focus on enhancing the last mile delivery industry.

The Agenda proposes a framework of high-level issues that countries should consider in their own domestic policy discussions and aims to guide staff from the two institutions in their own work and dialogue with national authorities. The 12 elements (see table) were distilled from members’ own experiences and cover topics relating broadly to enabling fintech; ensuring financial sector resilience; addressing risks; and promoting international cooperation.

“There are an estimated 1.7 billion adults in the world without access to financial services,” said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. “Fintech can have a major social and economic impact for them and across the membership in general. All countries are trying to reap these benefits, while also mitigating the risks. We need greater international cooperation to achieve that, and to make sure the fintech revolution benefits the many and not just the few. This Agenda provides a useful framework for countries to assess their policy options and adapt them to their own circumstances and priorities.”

“The Bali Fintech Agenda provides a framework to support the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in low-income countries, where access to financial services is low,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. “Countries are demanding deeper access to financial markets, and the World Bank Group will focus on delivering fintech solutions that enhance financial services, mitigate risks, and achieve stable, inclusive economic growth.”

Mrs. Lagarde and Dr. Kim presented the Agenda in a panel discussion today during the Annual Meetings in Bali. They were joined by Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Minister of Finance of Indonesia; Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank; and Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Financial Stability Board.

With their near universal membership, the Fund and the Bank, are well positioned to gather information from all countries and to reflect on their respective needs and objectives at various levels of economic and technological development. They both also offer a forum for sharing the experience of countries that are not members of international standard-setting bodies on issues such as combating money laundering and terrorism financing, market integrity, and consumer protection. The Financial Stability Board and several other international standard-setters have been reviewing the implications of fintech developments and have indicated regulation and supervision priorities.

The IMF and World Bank will start developing specific work programs on fintech, as the nature and scope of their members’ needs become clearer, in response to the Bali Fintech Agenda. The IMF’s initial focus will be on the implications for national and global monetary and financial stability; and the evolution of the International Monetary System and global financial safety net.

In response to the Bali Fintech Agenda, the World Bank will focus on using fintech to deepen financial markets, enhance responsible access to financial services, and improve cross-border payments and remittance transfer systems. The Bank will draw on the International Finance Corporation’s growing experience in this area. The Agenda contributes to building the foundations of the digital economy that is a key pillar in the World Bank Group’s larger disruptive technologies engagement.

The Bali Fintech Agenda:

Embrace the promise of fintech. Enable new technologies to enhance financial service provision. Reinforce competition and commitment to open, free, and contestable markets. Foster fintech to promote financial inclusion and develop financial markets. Monitor developments closely to deepen understanding of evolving financial systems. Adapt regulatory framework and supervisory practices for orderly development and stability of the financial system. Safeguard the integrity of financial systems. Modernize legal frameworks to provide an enabling legal landscape. Ensure the stability of domestic monetary and financial systems. Develop robust financial and data infrastructure to sustain fintech benefits. Encourage international cooperation and information-sharing. Enhance collective surveillance of the international monetary and financial system.

The Bali Fintech Agenda

Embrace the Promise of Fintech with its far-reaching social and economic impact, particularly in low-income countries, small states, and for the underserved, and prepare to capture its possible wide-ranging benefits, including: increasing access to financial services and financial inclusion; deepening financial markets; and improving cross-border payments and remittance transfer systems. Reaping these benefits requires preparation, strengthening of institutional capacity, expanding outreach to stakeholders, and adopting a cross-agency approach involving relevant ministries and agencies.

Enable New Technologies to Enhance Financial Service Provision by facilitating foundational infrastructures, fostering their open and affordable access, and ensuring a conducive policy environment. Foundational infrastructures include telecommunications, along with digital and financial infrastructures (such as broadband internet, mobile data services, data repositories, and payment and settlement services). The infrastructures should enable efficient data collection, processing, and transmission, which are central in fintech advances.

Reinforce Competition and Commitment to Open, Free, and Contestable Markets to ensure a level playing field and to promote innovation, consumer choice, and access to high-quality financial services. The successful and large-scale adoption of technology would be facilitated by an enabling policy framework regardless of the market participant, underlying technology, or method by which the service is provided. Policymakers should address the risks of market concentration, and should foster standardization, interoperability, and fair-and-transparent access to key infrastructures.

Foster Fintech to Promote Financial Inclusion and Develop Financial Markets by overcoming challenges related to reach, customer information, and commercial viability, and by improving infrastructure. The evolving digital economy together with effective supervision are essential in overcoming long-standing barriers to financial inclusion across a broad range of financial services and in enabling developing countries to leverage promising new pathways for economic and financial development to support growth and alleviate poverty. Examples include expanding access to finance while reducing costs, providing new ways to raise funding, enabling new information services to assess risks, and spurring new businesses. To achieve these goals, fintech issues should be part of a national inclusion and financial and digital literacy strategies, while fostering knowledge-sharing between public- and private-sector players, civil society, and other stakeholders.

Monitor Developments Closely to Deepen Understanding of Evolving Financial Systems to support the formulation of policies that foster the benefits of fintech and mitigate potential risks. The rapid pace of fintech will necessitate improvements and possible extensions in the reach of monitoring frameworks to support public-policy goals and to avoid disruptions to the financial system. Information-sharing and exchange would support improved monitoring. Achieving these objectives brings out the importance of continuous monitoring—including by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the industry, both innovators and incumbents—to identify emerging opportunities and risks, and to facilitate the timely formation of policy responses.

Adapt Regulatory Framework and Supervisory Practices for Orderly Development and Stability of the Financial System and facilitate the safe entry of new products, activities, and intermediaries; sustain trust and confidence; and respond to risks. Many fintech risks might be addressed by existing regulatory frameworks. However, new issues may arise from new firms, products, and activities that lie outside the current regulatory perimeter. This may require the modification and adaptation of regulatory frameworks to contain risks of arbitrage, while recognizing that regulation should remain proportionate to the risks. Holistic policy responses may be needed at the national level, building on guidance provided by standard-setting bodies.

Safeguard the Integrity of Financial Systems by identifying, understanding, assessing, and mitigating the risks of criminal misuse of fintech, and by using technologies that strengthen compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures. While fintech innovation generally supports legitimate goals, some innovations may enable users to evade current controls for criminal ends, thus posing a threat to financial integrity. Country responses have varied considerably; but, in all cases, it is important to strengthen AML/CFT compliance and monitoring, including by using technology (Regtech and Suptech solutions) to support regulatory compliance and supervision.

Modernize Legal Frameworks to Provide an Enabling Legal Landscape with greater legal clarity and certainty regarding key aspects of fintech activities. Sound legal frameworks support trust and reliability in financial products and services. This is undermined, however, where legal frameworks fail to keep pace with fintech innovation and evolving global financial markets. An enabling legal framework can be fashioned by having clear and predictable legal rules that accommodate technological change, tailored to national circumstances, particularly in areas such as contracts, data ownership, insolvency, resolution, and payments.

Ensure the Stability of Domestic Monetary and Financial Systems by considering the implications of fintech innovations to central banking services and market structure, while: safeguarding financial stability; expanding, if needed, safety nets; and ensuring effective monetary policy transmission. Fintech could transform the financial markets through which monetary policy actions are transmitted and could challenge the conduct of monetary policy as well as redefine central banks’ role as lenders of last resort. On the other hand, fintech could help central banks improve their services, including potentially issuing digital currency, and expanding access to and improving the resilience of payments services.

Develop Robust Financial and Data Infrastructure to Sustain Fintech Benefits that are resilient to disruptions––including from cyber-attacks––and that support trust and confidence in the financial system by protecting the integrity of data and financial services. Developing such robust infrastructure raises a broad spectrum of issues that are relevant not only to the financial sector but also to the digital economy at large, including data ownership, protection, and privacy, cybersecurity, operational and concentration risks, and consumer protection.

Encourage International Cooperation and Information-Sharing across the global regulatory community to share knowledge, experience, and best practices to support an effective regulatory framework. As new technologies increasingly operate across borders, international cooperation is essential to ensure effective policy responses to foster opportunities and to limit risks that could arise from divergence in regulatory frameworks. Sharing experiences and best practices with the private sector and with the public at large would help catalyze discussion on the most effective regulatory response, considering country circumstances, and to build a global consensus. The IMF and World Bank can help in facilitating the global dialogue and information-sharing.

Enhance Collective Surveillance of the International Monetary and Financial System and the adaptation and development of policies to support inclusive global growth, poverty alleviation, and international financial stability in an environment of rapid change. Fintech is blurring financial boundaries—both institutionally and geographically—potentially amplifying interconnectedness, spillovers, and capital flow volatility. These developments could lead to increased multipolarity and interconnectedness of the global financial system, potentially affecting the balance of risks for global financial stability. The IMF and World Bank could help in improving collective surveillance and assist member countries via capacity building, in collaboration with other international bodies."

Taking place in Bali, Indonesia from 8th-14th October, this forum provides the opportunity to discuss current economic global issues and hear from key economic leaders.

Key topics include the world economic outlook, poverty eradication, economic development and aid effectiveness. You can follow the Twitter hashtag at #IMFMeetings for updates.

The Bali Fintech Agenda

A highly anticipated and exciting seminar this year is the Bali Fintech. Meaning Financial Technology, the Bali Fintech sought to address the opportunities and challenges surrounding technological innovations.

At the same time, this seminar brings new financial technologies like cryptocurrency and blockchain to the forefront. In turn, the panelists hoped to address the regulation and policies associated with the attached Bali Fintech agenda. A full summary of the Agenda is available here and you can watch the recorded seminar here.

.@Lagarde today joined Indonesian president @jokowi, @JimYongKim, @KganyagoLesetja, Carney of @FinStbBoard, Governor Perry & Sri Mulyani Indrawati to launch the #BaliFintech Agenda, a roadmap to help our members reap the benefits and avoid the risks of the #fintech revolution. pic.twitter.com/5LBaamFuQH — IMF (@IMFNews) October 11, 2018

Highlights of the seminar

With a stellar lineup including Geoff Cutmore, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Jim Yong Kim, Christine Lagarde, Lesetja Kganyago and Mark Carney, this seminar produced some interesting comments from some of the world’s top economic leaders.

Fintech as a unifying force

As a whole, there proved to be general consensus surrounding the benefits. This included the power of Fintech to unifying, to connect people across borders and be apart of exciting global change.

Lesetja Kganyago, senator of the South African Reserve Bank suggested Fintech’s ability to connect could also reduce poverty. This is through a more peer-to-peer approach, which would “reduce remittances between the developed world and the developing world” .

Financial technology – or fintech – is transforming the world’s economic landscape. But the world of cashless payments, crowdfunding platforms and digital currency isn’t just making life easier, it could help reduce poverty and support growth. #BaliFintech https://t.co/bqFx6bEjIU — CNBC International (@CNBCi) October 11, 2018

Reiterated by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, poverty eradication and increased globalisation was at the forefront of discussion. In terms of how she views Fintech, Lagarde stated that:

“My two priorities are to Make sure it [fintech] is used to include as many people in the financial world and second, make sure it doesn’t damage the financial stability that is common good for all of us”

Carney: cross border payments currently cost ten times more than domestic ones. This is unacceptable. Let’s look to #Fintech for solutions. #BaliFintech pic.twitter.com/AXzOthUHBU — IMFLive (@IMFLive) October 11, 2018

Fintech’s power to disrupt

Another central point of discussion from this seminar was how Fintech is a disruptive and innovative force. Within this, Fintech was also suggested to be a tool to enhance efficiency and to ultimately improve the experience of consumers world wide.

With Jim Yong Kim celebrating the “enormous potential” of the distributed ledger and blockchain software, there was no doubt that these leaders realised the importance of integrating Fintech within the traditional financial market.

The other side of the coin

This was not met with doubts, with the discussion meditator Geoff Cutmore opening with how the rapid technological developments are “uncomfortable”. It appeared that this was not the general consensus among panelists, who instead focused on the enormous potential and opportunities that come with embracing new technology.

So where does crypto fit in?

With Fintech encompassing all digital financial services and technology, it is difficult to decipher where crypto specifically fits in.

What we can say is there is growing acceptance for digital innovation within the financial sector. It is promising with many leaders at the summit expressing a willingness to embrace technological innovations.

In light of the IMF meetings, Our CEO, Ben Ingram, was recently interviewed by CoinCast and will be discussing the stability of the digital current market. Airing tonight, 12th October at 7:30PM (AEST) on Sky News Business, we are excited to be apart of discussions for Fintech’s development.

What’s next

And for a relatively new technology like cryptocurrency and blockchain, discussions on a global stage are a positive step forward in the mainstream adoption for these technologies.

All in all, the crypto community can remain hopeful for wider acceptance for digital innovations. As eloquently put at the beginning of the Bali Fintech Agenda, Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo, said:"

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Financial Services Authority of the Republic of Indonesia, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthen cooperation in FinTech and foster innovation in financial services between Indonesia and Singapore.

The MOU will facilitate information sharing on emerging FinTech market trends and developments, and promote joint innovation projects between both countries. As part of the MOU, both authorities will establish a framework to help FinTech companies better understand the regulatory regime and opportunities in each jurisdiction. This will lower the barriers of entry for FinTech companies interested in entering the other’s market.



Mr Wimboh Santoso, Chairman of Indonesia Financial Services Authority, said, “We look forward to fostering a closer collaboration with MAS to support the development of FinTech and innovative financial services across the two jurisdictions.”



Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director, MAS, said, “Singapore and Indonesia have vibrant FinTech sectors, and MAS and OJK share a common interest in promoting innovation in financial services to enhance financial inclusion within the region. This MOU presents a good opportunity to strengthen cross-border efforts to promote the FinTech ecosystem in ASEAN.”



The signing of the MOU took place on the sidelines of the Indonesia-Singapore Leaders’ Retreat on 11 October 2018."

At the same time, they should work together to ensure they can respond better to the challenges posed by fintech.

New technologies such as mobile banking, big data, and peer-to-peer transfer networks are already extending the reach of financial services to those who were previously unbanked or out of reach, boosting incomes and living standards. Yet, fintech also comes with the risk of cyber fraud, data security, and privacy breaches. Disintermediation of fintech services or concentration of services among a few providers could also pose a risk to financial stability.

These and other issues were discussed at the High-Level Policy Dialogue on Regional Cooperation to Support Innovation, Inclusion, and Stability in Asia, organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Bank Indonesia, and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO).

The panel comprised Ms. Neav Chanthana, Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia; Mr. Diwa Guinigundo, Deputy Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; Ms. Mary Ellen Iskenderian, President and Chief Executive Officer of Women’s World Banking; Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore; Mr. Takehiko Nakao, President of ADB; Mr. Abdul Rasheed, Deputy Governor, Bank Negara Malaysia, and Mr. Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the Bank of Thailand. Mr. Mirza Adityaswara, Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia, gave the opening remarks at the conference and Ms. Junhong Chang, Director of AMRO, gave the welcome remarks.

“Rapidly spreading new financial technologies hold huge promise for financial inclusion,” said Mr. Nakao. “We must foster an enabling environment for the technologies to flourish and strengthen regional cooperation to build harmonized regulatory standards and surveillance systems to prevent international money laundering, terrorism financing, and cybercrimes.”

“Technology is an enabler that weaves our economies and financial systems together, transmitting benefits but also risks across borders,” said Ms. Chang. “Given East Asia’s rapid economic growth, understanding and managing the impact of technology in our financial systems is essential for policymakers to maintain financial stability.”

“Asia, including Indonesia, is an ideal place for fintech to flourish,” said Mr. Adityaswara. “In Indonesia’s case, there are more than a quarter of a billion people living on thousand of islands, waiting to be integrated with the new technology; young people eager to enter the future digital world; more than fifty million small and medium-sized enterprises which can’t wait to get on board with e-commerce; a new society driven by a dynamic, democratic middle class which views the digital economy as something as inevitable as evolution.”

Despite Asia’s high economic growth in recent years, the financial sector is still under-developed in some countries. Fewer than 27% of adults in developing Asia have a bank account, well below the global median of 38%. Meanwhile, just 84% of firms have a checking or savings account, on a par with Africa but below Latin America’s 89% and emerging Europe’s 92%.

Financial inclusion could be increased through policies to promote financial innovation, by boosting financial literacy, and by expanding and upgrading digital infrastructure and networks. Regulations to prevent illegal activities, enhance cyber security, and protect consumers’ rights and privacy, would also build confidence in new financial technologies."

Source: Fintech won’t drain money away from banks, regulators say

The rise of financial technology — more commonly known as fintech — won’t threaten the existence of banks, policymakers and regulators said at the IMF-World Bank annual meetings on Thursday.

It’s the responsibility of authorities to make sure that traditional banks are prepared for changes in their industry, they added.

The rise of financial technology — more commonly known as fintech — won’t threaten the existence of banks and it’s the responsibility of authorities to make sure that traditional lenders are prepared for changes in their industry, policymakers and regulators said in a CNBC-moderated panel Thursday.

The comments were made in Bali, Indonesia where the

International Monetary Fund

and the

World Bank

are holding their annual meetings. The two organizations on Thursday jointly launched a paper, the

Bali Fintech Agenda

, to help policymakers around the world strike a balance between encouraging financial innovation and safeguarding the stability of the system.

CNBC’s Geoff Cutmore moderated a panel discussion in Bali to discuss the contents of the paper. He asked the panelists whether it’s a good idea to allow fintech firms to “cherry pick” profitable segments of the banking industry to operate in — therefore taking money away from a legacy system that’s built up over decades and has weathered financial crises.

That question, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, is akin to asking “whether it’s a good idea to protect the banks from serving consumers better?”

Carney, who was one of the panelists at the event, said many small and medium-sized enterprises in the United Kingdom face high costs in tapping the formal banking system for funds. Therefore, reaching those businesses through fintech is “not taking liquidity away, that’s providing new liquidity” into the financial system, he said.

The key is to ensure that technological transformation in the financial industry can bring about the maximum benefit and at a minimum costs, which is a “classical problem” that many policymakers face, said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesia’s finance minister who was also a panelist.

The Indonesian government’s stance, she added, is that technology can not only help to improve existing ways of doing things but also to pressure the incumbents to improve their business models.

“For the existing business model, like banking, can they do innovation just as agile and innovative? It could be that some of them could come up with a totally different idea and that’s good,” she said.

As the financial industry increases its technology adoption, the crop of regulators — too — need be refreshed, noted Lesetja Kganyago, governor of the South Africa Reserve Bank.

“Regulators are usually lawyers and accountants, but we need people who understand data science and technology,” he said during the panel discussion."

«The digital economy is disrupting work and indeed, lives. This means that educators need to collaborate to reinvent and update their skills to keep pace with industry developments,» said Benedict Cheong, chief executive of TF INTL in a press statement.

Educators To Benefit

This programme will enable educators from Indonesia and Singapore to exchange knowledge and develop new ways to train aspiring youths in financial technology, Cheong said.

«We hope to develop lecturers with high performance and good understanding in Financial Technology, to supply talent who can compete in the industry’s 4.0 era. This MoU will give a lot of benefits to Indonesia’s Higher Education, especially in universities and polytechnics in Indonesia,» said Ir. Paristiyanti Nurwardani, director of learning of MoRTHE.

Commitment

TF INTL has committed a grant of about S$523,000 for this cross-border programme, which will include experiential learning through lab crawls, hackathons, seminars and workshops.

The course participants will get to visit and network with FinTech developers and users to gain fresh insights into the emerging field, as well as take part in challenges that will inspire innovative applications for the financial sector.

The round was joined by Skystar Capital, as well as existing investors Beenext and Convergence, Dekoruma said in a statement.

Founded in 2016, Dekoruma started out as an online marketplace for furniture and household appliances but has since developed to become an end-to-end home & living platform in Indonesia that provides B2C/B2B retail and services to both end-customers and property developers.

The company provides a platform which matches homeowners with interior designers who will design their houses using Dekoruma’s real time design platform. The platform also connects them to partner workshops for production, contractors for assembly and installation, as well as third-party vendors such as mechanical & electrical or flooring & wall painting.

It currently claims to run more than 500 simultaneous unique Design & Build projects at any point in time, each valued at around Rp 70-100 million, accomplished by more than 100 interior design partners based in Jakarta.

The newly raised capital, the company said, will be used to improve the company’s proprietary Design & Build platform, extending supply chain capacity, and services expansion to other cities.

“Seeing how the industry has arrived at status quo since decades ago, it is only a matter of time till this multi-billion dollar industry enjoy optimization through technology that we are building. Just imagine the big and lucrative opportunities that will emerge by then,” said Dekoruma founder and CEO Dimas Harry Priawan.

For GDN, which is more popularly known for its flagship e-commerce firm Blibli, the funding in Dekoruma is its first publicly known investment since its participation in the $1.5 billion funding round in ride-hailing firm Go-Jek in February.

As for AddVentures, the investment in Dekoruma follows its recent backing of Indonesian online B2B marketplace Ralali last month. Addventures’ parent company SCG is one of the leaders in building materials and industrial supplies in Thailand.

'There are an estimated 1.7 billion adults in the world without access to financial services,' said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. 'Fintech can have a major social and economic impact for them and across the membership in general. All countries are trying to reap these benefits, while also mitigating the risks. We need greater international cooperation to achieve that, and to make sure the fintech revolution benefits the many and not just the few. This Agenda provides a useful framework for countries to assess their policy options and adapt them to their own circumstances and priorities.

'The Bali Fintech Agenda provides a framework to support the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in low-income countries, where access to financial services is low,' World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. 'Countries are demanding deeper access to financial markets, and the World Bank Group will focus on delivering fintech solutions that enhance financial services, mitigate risks, and achieve stable, inclusive economic growth.'

Mrs. Lagarde and Dr. Kim presented the Agenda in a panel discussion today during the Annual Meetings in Bali. They were joined by Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Minister of Finance of Indonesia; Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank; and Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Financial Stability Board.

With their near universal membership, the Fund and the Bank, are well positioned to gather information from all countries and to reflect on their respective needs and objectives at various levels of economic and technological development. They both also offer a forum for sharing the experience of countries that are not members of international standard-setting bodies on issues such as combating money laundering and terrorism financing, market integrity, and consumer protection. The Financial Stability Board and several other international standard-setters have been reviewing the implications of fintech developments and have indicated regulation and supervision priorities.

The IMF and World Bank will start developing specific work programs on fintech, as the nature and scope of their members' needs become clearer, in response to the Bali Fintech Agenda. The IMF's initial focus will be on the implications for national and global monetary and financial stability; and the evolution of the International Monetary System and global financial safety net.

In response to the Bali Fintech Agenda, the World Bank will focus on using fintech to deepen financial markets, enhance responsible access to financial services, and improve cross-border payments and remittance transfer systems. The Bank will draw on the International Finance Corporation's growing experience in this area. The Agenda contributes to building the foundations of the digital economy that is a key pillar in the World Bank Group's larger disruptive technologies engagement.

Executive Board Statement

IMF Executive Directors welcomed the opportunity to consider the Bali Fintech Agenda, and praised the excellent ongoing cooperation between the Fund and World Bank staff in this area, along with other international bodies. Directors broadly endorsed the Agenda as a framework for the consideration of high level fintech issues by individual country members, including in their own domestic policy discussions. They recognized that the Agenda does not represent a work program for the Fund and World Bank Group. Directors concurred that the elements of the Agenda have broad relevance to all member countries and that national authorities should tailor the application of these elements in light of their specific circumstances. This would help reap the benefits of fintech while remaining vigilant about the potential risks and enhancing preparedness to address them. Directors also noted that the elements of the Agenda could apply to both conventional and Islamic financial instruments and products.

While recognizing the rapid pace of fintech development and its uncertain impact, Directors concurred that fintech offers wide ranging possibilities in deepening and enhancing the efficiencies of financial systems, broadening access to financial services-especially in low income countries and for underserved populations-and supporting broader economic development and inclusive growth. They acknowledged the potential risks posed by rapid technological changes to financial systems and individual users and stressed the need for adequate preparation and cross agency coordination by national authorities, including through strengthening of institutional capacity, building up knowledge, improving communication with stakeholders, and expanding consumer education. Directors called on the Fund to stand ready to provide technical assistance, particularly for countries with significant capacity gaps, while facilitating information sharing.

Directors generally considered the elements of the Agenda as broadly balanced in pointing out opportunities while acknowledging potential risks of fintech. They agreed on the need to strike the right balance between enabling financial innovation and reinforcing competition and the commitment to open, free and contestable markets on the one hand and addressing challenges to financial integrity, consumer protection, and financial stability on the other.

Directors broadly agreed on the need to augment regulatory and legal frameworks to support the sound development of fintech services and safeguard financial systems. They called for close international cooperation and coordination to address regulatory gaps and prevent the potential risk of a race to the bottom in regulatory compliance, including Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism compliance and the spread of global systemic risks.

Directors called on staff to work closely with the standard setting bodies (SSBs) and relevant international bodies, while avoiding duplication and overlap. They encouraged staff to continuously monitor and analyze fintech developments and consider their implications within the Fund's mandate, focusing on analytical and country work with respect to cross border capital flows, financial integrity, national and global monetary and financial stability, and the evolution of the International Monetary System and global financial safety net.

ANNEX

The Bali Fintech Agenda

I. Embrace the Promise of Fintech with its far-reaching social and economic impact, particularly in low-income countries, small states, and for the underserved, and prepare to capture its possible wide-ranging benefits, including: increasing access to financial services and financial inclusion; deepening financial markets; and improving cross-border payments and remittance transfer systems. Reaping these benefits requires preparation, strengthening of institutional capacity, expanding outreach to stakeholders, and adopting a cross-agency approach involving relevant ministries and agencies.

II. Enable New Technologies to Enhance Financial Service Provision by facilitating foundational infrastructures, fostering their open and affordable access, and ensuring a conducive policy environment. Foundational infrastructures include telecommunications, along with digital and financial infrastructures (such as broadband internet, mobile data services, data repositories, and payment and settlement services). The infrastructures should enable efficient data collection, processing, and transmission, which are central in fintech advances.

III. Reinforce Competition and Commitment to Open, Free, and Contestable Markets to ensure a level playing field and to promote innovation, consumer choice, and access to high-quality financial services. The successful and large-scale adoption of technology would be facilitated by an enabling policy framework regardless of the market participant, underlying technology, or method by which the service is provided. Policymakers should address the risks of market concentration, and should foster standardization, interoperability, and fair-and-transparent access to key infrastructures.

IV. Foster Fintech to Promote Financial Inclusion and Develop Financial Markets by overcoming challenges related to reach, customer information, and commercial viability, and by improving infrastructure. The evolving digital economy together with effective supervision are essential in overcoming long-standing barriers to financial inclusion across a broad range of financial services and in enabling developing countries to leverage promising new pathways for economic and financial development to support growth and alleviate poverty. Examples include expanding access to finance while reducing costs, providing new ways to raise funding, enabling new information services to assess risks, and spurring new businesses. To achieve these goals, fintech issues should be part of a national inclusion and financial and digital literacy strategies, while fostering knowledge-sharing between public- and private-sector players, civil society, and other stakeholders.

V. Monitor Developments Closely to Deepen Understanding of Evolving Financial Systems to support the formulation of policies that foster the benefits of fintech and mitigate potential risks. The rapid pace of fintech will necessitate improvements and possible extensions in the reach of monitoring frameworks to support public-policy goals and to avoid disruptions to the financial system. Information-sharing and exchange would support improved monitoring. Achieving these objectives brings out the importance of continuous monitoring-including by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the industry, both innovators and incumbents-to identify emerging opportunities and risks, and to facilitate the timely formation of policy responses.

VI. Adapt Regulatory Framework and Supervisory Practices for Orderly Development and Stability of the Financial System and facilitate the safe entry of new products, activities, and intermediaries; sustain trust and confidence; and respond to risks. Many fintech risks might be addressed by existing regulatory frameworks. However, new issues may arise from new firms, products, and activities that lie outside the current regulatory perimeter. This may require the modification and adaptation of regulatory frameworks to contain risks of arbitrage, while recognizing that regulation should remain proportionate to the risks. Holistic policy responses may be needed at the national level, building on guidance provided by standard-setting bodies.

VII. Safeguard the Integrity of Financial Systems by identifying, understanding, assessing, and mitigating the risks of criminal misuse of fintech, and by using technologies that strengthen compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures. While fintech innovation generally supports legitimate goals, some innovations may enable users to evade current controls for criminal ends, thus posing a threat to financial integrity. Country responses have varied considerably; but, in all cases, it is important to strengthen AML/CFT compliance and monitoring, including by using technology (Regtech and Suptech solutions) to support regulatory compliance and supervision.

VIII. Modernize Legal Frameworks to Provide an Enabling Legal Landscape with greater legal clarity and certainty regarding key aspects of fintech activities. Sound legal frameworks support trust and reliability in financial products and services. This is undermined, however, where legal frameworks fail to keep pace with fintech innovation and evolving global financial markets. An enabling legal framework can be fashioned by having clear and predictable legal rules that accommodate technological change, tailored to national circumstances, particularly in areas such as contracts, data ownership, insolvency, resolution, and payments.

IX. Ensure the Stability of Domestic Monetary and Financial Systems by considering the implications of fintech innovations to central banking services and market structure, while: safeguarding financial stability; expanding, if needed, safety nets; and ensuring effective monetary policy transmission. Fintech could transform the financial markets through which monetary policy actions are transmitted and could challenge the conduct of monetary policy as well as redefine central banks' role as lenders of last resort. On the other hand, fintech could help central banks improve their services, including potentially issuing digital currency, and expanding access to and improving the resilience of payments services.

X. Develop Robust Financial and Data Infrastructure to Sustain Fintech Benefits that are resilient to disruptions--including from cyber-attacks--and that support trust and confidence in the financial system by protecting the integrity of data and financial services. Developing such robust infrastructure raises a broad spectrum of issues that are relevant not only to the financial sector but also to the digital economy at large, including data ownership, protection, and privacy, cybersecurity, operational and concentration risks, and consumer protection.

XI. Encourage International Cooperation and Information-Sharing across the global regulatory community to share knowledge, experience, and best practices to support an effective regulatory framework. As new technologies increasingly operate across borders, international cooperation is essential to ensure effective policy responses to foster opportunities and to limit risks that could arise from divergence in regulatory frameworks. Sharing experiences and best practices with the private sector and with the public at large would help catalyze discussion on the most effective regulatory response, considering country circumstances, and to build a global consensus. The IMF and World Bank can help in facilitating the global dialogue and information-sharing.

XII. Enhance Collective Surveillance of the International Monetary and Financial System and the adaptation and development of policies to support inclusive global growth, poverty alleviation, and international financial stability in an environment of rapid change. Fintech is blurring financial boundaries-both institutionally and geographically-potentially amplifying interconnectedness, spillovers, and capital flow volatility. These developments could lead to increased multipolarity and interconnectedness of the global financial system, potentially affecting the balance of risks for global financial stability. The IMF and World Bank could help in improving collective surveillance and assist member countries via capacity building, in collaboration with other international bodies."
34;793765547;20181011;2018;https://www.adb.org/news/asia-needs-region-wide-approach-harness-fintechs-full-potential;"BALI, INDONESIA (11 October 2018) — Asia’s policy makers should strengthen cooperation to harness the potential of new financial technologies for inclusive growth. At the same time, they should work together to ensure they can respond better to the challenges posed by fintech.

New technologies such as mobile banking, big data, and peer-to-peer transfer networks are already extending the reach of financial services to those who were previously unbanked or out of reach, boosting incomes and living standards. Yet, fintech also comes with the risk of cyber fraud, data security, and privacy breaches. Disintermediation of fintech services or concentration of services among a few providers could also pose a risk to financial stability.

These and other issues were discussed at the High-Level Policy Dialogue on Regional Cooperation to Support Innovation, Inclusion, and Stability in Asia, organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Bank Indonesia, and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO).

The panel comprised Ms. Neav Chanthana, Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia; Mr. Diwa Guinigundo, Deputy Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; Ms. Mary Ellen Iskenderian, President and Chief Executive Officer of Women’s World Banking; Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore; Mr. Takehiko Nakao, President of ADB; Mr. Abdul Rasheed, Deputy Governor, Bank Negara Malaysia, and Mr. Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the Bank of Thailand. Mr. Mirza Adityaswara, Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia, gave the opening remarks at the conference and Ms. Junhong Chang, Director of AMRO, gave the welcome remarks.

“Rapidly spreading new financial technologies hold huge promise for financial inclusion,” said Mr. Nakao. “We must foster an enabling environment for the technologies to flourish and strengthen regional cooperation to build harmonized regulatory standards and surveillance systems to prevent international money laundering, terrorism financing, and cybercrimes.”

“Technology is an enabler that weaves our economies and financial systems together, transmitting benefits but also risks across borders,” said Ms. Chang. “Given East Asia’s rapid economic growth, understanding and managing the impact of technology in our financial systems is essential for policymakers to maintain financial stability.”

“Asia, including Indonesia, is an ideal place for fintech to flourish,” said Mr. Adityaswara. “In Indonesia’s case, there are more than a quarter of a billion people living on thousand of islands, waiting to be integrated with the new technology; young people eager to enter the future digital world; more than fifty million small and medium-sized enterprises which can’t wait to get on board with e-commerce; a new society driven by a dynamic, democratic middle class which views the digital economy as something as inevitable as evolution.”

Despite Asia’s high economic growth in recent years, the financial sector is still under-developed in some countries. Fewer than 27% of adults in developing Asia have a bank account, well below the global median of 38%. Meanwhile, just 84% of firms have a checking or savings account, on a par with Africa but below Latin America’s 89% and emerging Europe’s 92%.

Financial inclusion could be increased through policies to promote financial innovation, by boosting financial literacy, and by expanding and upgrading digital infrastructure and networks. Regulations to prevent illegal activities, enhance cyber security, and protect consumers’ rights and privacy, would also build confidence in new financial technologies.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing."
35;793797334;20181011;2018;http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/central-bank-heads-keen-benefit-fintech-toolkit;"Central bank governors from Commonwealth countries backed a proposal to create a toolkit that will help banks leverage technological innovations in the finance sector to maximise economic growth.

At the Commonwealth Central Bank Governors meeting held this week in Bali, Indonesia, Commonwealth experts outlined plans for a toolkit on financial innovation, also known as ‘Fintech’. The aim is to embrace the rapid pace of Fintech, while ensuring it is properly regulated in member states.

The package will include model laws on cybersecurity and bankruptcy, amongst others, which countries can tailor to their specific needs. A Commonwealth regulators’ directory to support collaboration across agencies, as well as tactics to attract investment for innovators are also planned.

The Governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Timothy Antoine, opened the meeting. He described the rise of new technology such as smartphone banking apps, peer-to-peer lending, digital wallets, crowd funding, and crypto-assets as “breath-taking”.

“Central banks ought to be both responsible and responsive, cognisant that the adoption speed of Fintech and its appropriate regulation will, to large extent, depend on the response of regulators like ourselves,” he told participants. “To that end, central banks should choose to lean in and help shape the orderly development of Fintech rather than lean back and adopt a wait and see attitude.”

Delegates from Kenya, Jamaica, eSwatini and the Eastern Caribbean States shared country experiences with Fintech, citing concerns about cybersecurity and data protection, limited internet access, and lack of expertise in tackling various risks.

“We support the toolkit, particularly because we have ventured into an area that we do not know so much about,” said the Governor of the Central Bank of eSwatini, Majozi V. Sithole. “If [a country] has learned something or can come up with successful lessons, it would be good to be shared.”

“We have problems with regulation, [faced] by all the countries. We can sit together and have contributions on this from all the countries – it will be important to build one model,” added the Head of International Relations at the Central Bank of Mozambique, Elsa Chambal.

The Head of the Small States Office at the Commonwealth, Travis Mitchell, welcomed the outcome of the discussions. He said the next step is to secure resources to create a robust toolkit that responds to the needs of member countries.

The outcome of the discussions will feed into the Commonwealth Finance Ministers’ Meeting on 11 October."
36;793900334;20181011;2018;https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/ngee-ann-poly-to-design-fintech-course-for-indonesia;"Temasek Foundation International and Ngee Ann Polytechnic will join forces with an Indonesian ministry on a new fintech programme to be implemented for tertiary students in the country.

They will work together over the next three years to provide a fintech curriculum to institutions such as Politeknik Negeri Jakarta and Universitas Indonesia, offering lab crawls, hackathons, seminars and workshops.

The partnership was inked yesterday under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Ngee Ann Polytechnic and the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education on the sidelines of the third Indonesia-Singapore Leaders' Retreat in Bali.

The collaboration is anchored by a grant of about $523,000 from Temasek Foundation International.

Ngee Ann Polytechnic principal Clarence Ti said in a statement: ""There's a lot our two countries can learn from each other as fintech starts to impact the way our populations gain access to financial services.

""This MOU is just the start of a conversation on how we can best support the growth of necessary skills in both our countries."""
37;793483591;20181010;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/23839/bigdata/singapore-artificial-intelligence-southeast-asia/;"It’s been quite a few years since huge parts of our lives have ported over to digitalisation, and almost by accident, many organisations have accumulated swaths of data that they’ve more recently just realised could be turned into valuable analytics.

Global trends by large corporations may hint at 2019 becoming the year of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Similar realisations have led to the prominence of machine learning and artificial intelligence in recent years, particularly in Singapore. There has even been talk about artificial intelligence as the fourth industrial revolution—probably why the Singaporean government is so keen on jumping aboard that train through advocacy, and throwing a lot of money into its development.

It probably helps that artificial intelligence could make it easier for the island nation to govern its people—the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) foray into suptech (supervisory technology) comes to mind.

Massive Government Effort into Growing AI

Almost literally putting money where their mouth is, Singapore has thrown a lot of money into supporting its growth.

In collaboration with Microsoft, Intel and Datacamp, Singapore launched two free AI courses, one to train up to 2,000 executives or those technologically inclined on artificial intelligence for future job opportunities, while another 10,000 a more rudimentary look into AI’s potential.

This is an effort to stopgap what relevant parties see as global shortage of AI talent.

That’s not all.

The National Research Foundation (NRF) has undertaken the AI Singapore programme, which aims to boost Singapore’s artificial intelligence capabilities, and tallies directly into its growing talent base. Its goal is to look at how AI could be used in healthcare, improving traffic output, and more relevant to fintech, broaden adoption of AI and machine learning within industries, with input from industry partners.

These efforts will be made in what the foundation refers to as a “makerspace environment” for interaction, collaboration, and encouragement of adoption.

“NRF aims to deliver 100 meaningful AI projects and proofs-of-concept to solve real-world problems quickly for end-users. There is particular potential in the sectors of finance, healthcare and city management solutions, which the programme will start with.”

It is a collaboration between the NRF, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SMART), the Economic Development Board (EDB), the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), SGInnovate, and Integrated Health Information Systems.

NRF has invested up to $150 million in the programme over five years.

A further $27 million by MAS goes into the Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Grant under the Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (FSTI) Scheme—one of the two tracks the financial institution track, where the grant would fund up to 50% of the project costs for projects that leverage AI and data analytics techniques to generate insights, formulate strategy, and assist in their decision making. These techniques may include machine learning, natural language processing or text analytics, deep learning or neural networks, predictive and prescriptive analytics. ear period.

Artificial intelligence will even be the focus of the Singapore Fintech Festival 2018, which goes to show that the bug that has bitten Singapore has delved into fintech as well.

Yet, Indonesia is said to lead the pack in Artificial Intelligence Adoption

This study by Forrester Consulting conducted for Appier shows that Indonesia leads the Asian Pacific pack in artificial intelligence adoption. Indonesia stands at 65% adoption, while Singapore lags at 50%. We found that the sample sizes for the report seemed a bit small, but similar results can be corroborated by an IDC Asia/Pacific Enterprise Cognitive/AI survey that found 24.6% of organisations in Indonesia adopting artificial intelligence, while Singapore is at 9.9%.

Indonesia is likely the region’s frontrunner in artificial intelligence, as McKinsey reported, due to its disruptive impact by automating roughly half of the work activities in a nation with a huge population. Indonesia could see 52% of all its activities automated.

The numbers are far apart and may require further and more thorough research, but the impression that is clear—Singapore lags behind in artificial intelligence adoption even among Southeast Asian countries.

In similar suit, skeptical voices are wondering if government advocacy has been doing enough to actually see tangible impact in artificial intelligence adoption. In fact, Singapore’s push to build a talent pool in the region through a free course likely comes from a realisation that Singapore is not yet equipped to ride the coming wave of artificial intelligence.

Data Security

With its high, if belated, interest in artificial intelligence, Singapore will not likely rise as an artificial intelligence powerhouse anytime soon. However, McKinsey reports that Singapore is, at least, ahead in artificial intelligence for fintech, perhaps due to longstanding existence of artificial intelligence startups for fintech.

It makes sense then that Singapore has aspirations towards becoming an artificial intelligence hub at least in this region, and has even released a voluntary governance code for ethical use of artifical intelligence and personal data. The governance is currently in the works, formed by K Rajah, a former attorney-general, Monetary authority of Singapore, and a five-year research programme on governance of AI and data, among other parties.

While the guideline could be a good benchmark to help someone identify organisations that one should or should not trust data with, the voluntary nature of the guideline may help curb accidental data misuse, but not malicious players.

There is also the issue of data hacks that Singapore’s fintech institutions need to take very seriously. The government health database hack comes to mind, impacting 1.5 million users, or around one-quarter of Singapore’s population and widely considered the biggest hack in Singapore. So far, there have been no large-scale attacks into any of Singapore’s existing artificial intelligence companies, but as more players begin thinking about and adopting artificial intelligence, new players may not be able to protect themselves as well as others might have.

Equipping the public with artificial intelligence knowledge could also equip them with the ability to do evil with juicy, newly formed gaps ready for the picking.

Overall, Singapore’s artificial intelligence conversations have been more focused on healthcare for its more obvious impact, but Singapore is in a pretty decent position to grow its fintech side, once its grants and research bear fruit.

However, even as we stand in a decent position for fintech artificial intelligence, Singapore is at a crucial crossroads. If we play our cards right, we could see widepsread public acceptance and adoption of artificial intelligence, which would, in turn, boost the trust and technology in finance as well.

For what it’s worth, it has been said that Singapore has been attracting artificial intelligence talent, which could reduce the nation’s dependence on local talent. There are also more Singaporeans that are ready to accept personalised artificial intelligence solutions, though the number still stands at 35%.

We may be a little behind, but there’s no reason why we can’t catch up."
38;793492592;20181010;2018;https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2018/10/10/experts-call-for-appropriate-e-commerce-taxation/;"Tax experts have called on governments to issue appropriate taxation regulations and tax rates specially tailored to suit e-commerce businesses in their countries.

This is the consensus reached during a panel discussion on Wednesday in Bali, Indonesia, titled “Fair and Transparent Taxation in a Digital Age”.

The experts agreed that technology and the increased role that intellectual property plays in the global economy was affecting approaches to taxation.

Mr Akhilesh Ranjan, the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, India said that his country had introduced the Equalisation Levy to ensure that e-commerce pay their fair share of tax.

He said that due to the nature of e-commerce, the country focused on e-advertising on foreign-based digital services, like Facebook which could easily be monitored.

“We collect 6 per cent levy on advertising services by an Indian company on any website.

“The company is expected to make the deductions before paying to the website.

“Since 2016 when we started, it has been very easy tax for us to collect. Many people don’t agree with it, but they still pay,” he said.

Also, Mr Alvin Mosioma, the Executive Director, Tax Justice Network, Africa, said that many tax bodies lacked the capacity to duly tax internet-based businesses because they refused to advance with digitalisation.

He warned that inadequate taxation in the digital space, could increase the level of Illicit Financial Flows by Multinational Corporations especially in Africa.

He said that more international cooperation was needed to tackle the increasing issues of tax evasion, as the world transforms into a digital economy.

Also, Mr Suahasil Nazara, the Head, Fiscal Policy Agency, Ministry of Finance, Indonesia said that governments should create a fair tax system for e-commerce, if not businesses would close shop and move online.

39;793160983;20181009;2018;https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2018/10/09/indonesia-building-a-startupnation-by-future-proofing-a-new-generation/;"In February 2018, Indonesia’s National Statistical Bureau reported that the country’s labor force had reached 133.94 million citizens – a 1.5% annual increase. But looking ahead, how can we ensure that Indonesians have the right skills to compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

Educators and students already know that digital skills will be critical to career success in a future driven by technology. According to the International Communication Union (ITU), 10 million jobs that require advanced digital skills – such as data science, coding, cybersecurity, Internet of Things and mobile app development – are going unfilled because employers cannot find the right talent.

A Microsoft study with IDC in February 2018 showed that 93% of jobs in the next three years will be transformed digitally. And, 68% of jobs will be redeployed as new positions with retraining and upskilling needed. While this is a transformation and not a displacement, intensive digital education is now a fundamental item on the national agenda. Teacher competency training is also being pursued by the Ministry of Education and Culture.

“In a new world driven by technology, all youth should have the opportunity to advance their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills by learning computer science. The key enabler to this process is the educator,” said Haris Izmee, President Director of Microsoft Indonesia. “Microsoft wants to empower every person and every organization, including educators and students on the planet to achieve more.”

Digital skills are essential to boost the economy. Businesses without these skills will be left behind. Understanding this necessity, Microsoft is partnering with the Ministry of Communications and Informatics to build a #StartUpNation by leveraging technology that is harnessing Indonesia’s entrepreneurial spirit and creative human capital.

Supported by Microsoft Indonesia certification, The Digital Talent Scholarship 2018 program is focusing on two goals: workforce skills development and future-proofing youth. The program kicked off with a three-day technology boot camp from13 – 15 September 2018 at Microsoft Indonesia office. Thirty-two lecturers from top universities in Indonesia took part, namely: Universitas Indonesia (UI), Universitas Gajah Mada (UGM), Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November Surabaya (ITS), Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), and Universitas Padjadjaran (UNPAD).

The scholarship program will continue in these universities for two months through direct training in ITB, ITS, UGM, and UI, while online training on digital business will be managed by UNPAD faculty of Economics and Business.

“Together with the Ministry of Communications and Informatics, we have formulated a curriculum for training, focusing on the most essential skills that are critical for participants from technical skills, career readiness soft skills, and growth mindset,” Haris said. “We believe that the four most important aspects to focus on for this training are cybersecurity, data science, cloud server administration, and artificial intelligence.”

Haryati, Research and Development Secretary for Human Resource, in the Ministry of Communication and Information (KOMINFO), said in her opening speech that training effort would help realize the “1,000 Youth Digital Skills” program by KOMINFO. “Human Resource development is important in its support of (President) Jokowi’s aspiration to strengthen Indonesia’s ecosystem that will lead to a stronger economy. We are proud and happy to partner with Microsoft to bring the program together with the five best universities in Indonesia.”

Today, the development of cloud computing is accelerating, enabling profound progress in every field within the industry. In the “Making Indonesia 4.0” roadmap, launched by President Joko Widodo last April 2018, Indonesia will focus on improving industry innovation, with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as one of the key sectors. Industry 4.0 is supported by five key technological advances: Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), human-machine interface, robot and sensor technology, and 3D printing.

“As an industry player and technology company, we have the responsibility to contribute in this roadmap,” Haris added.

The 32 lecturers in the program are expected to transfer their skills and knowledge to 1,000 students from the universities to help them become future-ready for the digital workforce. In December 2018, the students will join a graduation ceremony led by President Joko Widodo, that will also mark their next journey in carrying the torch to spread their advanced digital skills to more youth in Indonesia, building Indonesia #StartUpNation by 2020. The top student will also have the opportunity to join the Microsoft Certified Professional program.

Tony Seno Hartono, National Technology Officer at Microsoft Indonesia, is one of the trainers.

To provide context, Tony explained the evolving process of the Industrial Revolution. “The First Industrial Revolution used water and steam power to mechanize production. The Second used electric power to create mass production. The Third used electronics and information technology to automate production. Now, this Fourth Industrial Revolution is building on the Third – the digital revolution that has been occurring since the middle of the last century. Digitization is more than just a change of tools or technological devices. Daily practices, workplace structures, reporting relationships, information sharing, customer interaction, and even competition are also transformed. This disruption is changing the way we live, work, and play.”

“The growth of start-ups and unicorns in Indonesia is one of the keys that drive the digital economy in Indonesia. To balance this growth and to meet the demand in digitally-skilled human resources, we need this kind of initiative to bring tangible impact for our workforce,” said Haryati.

As we move toward 2021, we must expect that the digital transformation momentum to accelerate rapidly with more companies investing in big data, AI, IoT, and other digital transformation enablers. By then, 40% of total Indonesia’s GDP (and 48% of SEA’s GDP) is expected to be derived from digital products and services. Therefore, having a digitally-skilled workforce will be imperative for Indonesia to cope in the new era.

A Digital Innovation Summit was also held on Friday, September 21, 2018, at Graha Sanusi Hardjadinata, Universitas Padjajaran which also marked the launch of Digital Talent Scholarship 2018. The event was opened with a speech by the Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara who explained what the next generation needs to embrace digital revolution 4.0. “Our human resources development is still way behind the technology progress and development,” he said. The Ministry of Communication and Informatics sees the need to push the quality of youth in the fields that are most needed by labor recruiters today.

40;793212815;20181009;2018;https://fintechnews.my/18693/payments-remittance-malaysia/malaysia-payments-e-wallet-southeast-asia/;"According to SKMM, Malaysia’s smartphone penetration grew from 68.7% in 2016 to 75.9% in 2017, and by all measures, will most likely show an upwards trend this year too.

This puts our smartphone penetration at a slightly higher value than the Southeast Asian average, and perhaps why China’s e-wallets have their eyes on us for expansion. We are, for now, the only nation in the world that is able to use WeChat pay in our local denomination.

The environment is also fertile ground for payments in Malaysia to flourish, a renaissance of the e-commerce boom circa 2015 that led to the rise of payments fintech.

Malaysia’s payments scene hosts notable names such as Soft Space, which we have identified as one of Malaysia’s top funded fintech firms thanks to its Japanese expansion.

Other notable internet payment enablers that have been eking out a large portion of Malaysian business include iPay88, MOLPay, eGHL, with others like billplz also carving out their own niches.

Living in an ecosystem with a famously disjointed and messy parking system has also given rise to parking-related payments companies, such as JomParking—allowing Malaysians to pay via mobile phone instead of having to contend with token machines or noisy parking ticket machines.

But one cannot talk about the resurgence of the payments scene without also discussing the rise of e-wallets in this region, in a bid to emulate that worked in China and seemingly the next step in our e-payments evolution.

There’s lots of potential in our market for sure, but we don’t foresee any giants rising from this to see success outside of Malaysia, because:

Still Working on That E-Wallet Convergence

So far, we have not produced unicorn wallets yet ala GrabPay that has made its way here from Singapore, or even Go-Jek’s Go-Pay. Both of these unicorns didn’t start out in payments, but their status certainly helped grow and expand their offerings.

We talked about it before, but it is still a question worth asking: are there too many e-wallets in Malaysia? Opinions are still mixed, with some concerned about user fatigue while others argue that competition breeds excellence.

The field does seem promising. RM6.5 trillion was transacted through online banking, leaps and bounds over the billions in credit or debit card. This was part of the reason behind MOLPay’s and iPay88’s success, as making online purchases directly through their bank accounts seem more convenient.

In sheer value, debit and credit card transactions still overtake e-money transactions, yet in transaction volumes, e-wallets have overtaken card payments. This showcases some success in Malaysian e-wallet’s vision of enabling smaller transactions, as usually cards are imposed a minimum spending limit (illegally).

My personal observation so far is that many of the e-wallets in Malaysia are just doing what worked elsewhere, and offer nothing unique to cater to the Malaysian people. That being said, for what they are, some wallets certainly feel refined, and strategic partnerships do lead to heightened interest.

At this juncture, there are a few e-wallets that have begun to turn the tide in the coliseum and make a name for themselves, but it’s hard to say if any show signs of leading the curve.

In this, we are pretty much in the same boat with many other nations in Southeast Asia.

In all likeliness, considering the high penetration of e-wallets across neighbouring countries, whatever giant that rises in our region will probably stay within Malaysia.

Users in Singapore are long used to digital payment methods like PayPal, Visa Checkout, MasterPass, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and etc, but they and other Southeast Asian nations are no less inundated with large swaths of local players.

With the exception of Singapore, many Southeast Asian countries saw a sudden surge in e-wallets sometime in 2018.

It’s said that Philippines and Thailand have adapted well to the use of e-wallets, more than us, perhaps in no small part owing to a heightened need for financial access from low banked populations.

Meanwhile in Malaysia, e-wallets seem like an added hassle. Many of us already savvy to cashless prefer bank-affiliated cards, which already provides discounts or cashbacks. That’s at least 74% of Malaysians. This leaves wallets to target more cash-dominated areas, like hawker stalls, bazaars, or less developed areas with low card payment options.

While mobile phone penetration is high, only 28.4% of Malaysians have made purchases through a mobile phone.

We’re similar to Singapore in this regard, it citizens primarily using the NETS network that facilitates debit and credit card. In fact, Fintech News feels like Malaysia and Singapore are on a similar payments trajectory, only at different stages.

That’s not all we have in common.

Most Governments in Southeast Asia Have The Same Idea

Malaysia and other Southeast Asian governments are permissive or even encouraging of this e-wallet battleground, and growing internet infrastructure has been helping with adoption.

Many wallets eye a promising future ecosystem and hope that similar to China or Kenya, would eventually coalesce into convergence and the rise of a few dominant players.

In the meantime though, all of these wallets will have to absorb high prices in encouraging adoption, and cutting through the trust issues Southeast Asians have about mobile wallets.

Many Southeast Asian countries are united in firstly, encouraging interoperability between banks, and secondly evening out the battleground between financial institutions and new local players.

And Their Strategies Mimic Each Other

The Monetary Authority of Singapore has the Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR), a single QR code network that should be compatible with 27 e-payment providers in hopes of simplifying an increasingly messy landscape.

They’ve also been working on an interbank payment gateway, allowing both financial institutions and fintech firms quicker access to the nation’s Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) system.

Malaysia combines both of these functions into its Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework (ICTF) framework—planning to issue their own universal QR code (though it has been said that the ICTF won’t compel Malaysia’s wallets to be on the system, only make it available as an option). Its goal, in parts, is to put local e-wallets and banks on a more equal ground through encouraging interoperability.

One of its measures is the Real-Time Retail Payment Platform, with the long-term plan of linking one’s monetary account with unique identifiers like mobile numbers and IC numbers for payments.

The Indonesian central bank has its National Payment Gateway (NPG). The first phase last December was focused on building interbank infrastructure to reduce the cost of interbank transactions, and also reduce toll payments for road users.

The second phase, yet to be deployed, would facilitate lenders to cut cross-bank transaction costs by streamlining the process out of its inefficient bureaucratic layers. As an aside, this could boost Indonesia’s increasingly valuable P2P lending scene.

Phillippines’ InstaPay was built by the Banko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) in April to create smooth interoperability between different banks, though it may still require more banks on board to see a lot of value.

Many of these measures, while similar, are conducted in their own country silos.

This is in contrast with the Bank of Thailand and Cambodia, that have joined forces to roll out a joint QR code payment system by 2019. The Bank of Thailand has also initiated a cross-border fund transfer in collaboration with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, which hopes to reduce the costs for migrant workers to transfer funds between regions.

Focus on interoperability has forced existing financial institutions to expand or upgrade their payments systems as well, so many of them that were already doing so gained an advantage in that regard.

Conclusion

Malaysia, more recently Vietnam, and many other Southeast Asian nations can track the rise of digital payment fintech through the rise of e-commerce. Companies like MOLPay and iPay88 made their marks here specifically through increased digital payments for online shopping or food deliveries like foodpanda.

Now, similar payments companies could also see continued business through the plethora of e-wallets available, by facilitating online banking transfers from bank accounts into e-wallet accounts.

We think that Malaysia’s e-wallets still has a long way before it hits its peak, and Southeast Asia’s overall faith in the growth of e-wallets lends well to this conclusion.

The question is: will e-wallets here dethrone plain old plastic, or will they be players at equal footing?

With most of us on a similar trajectory, could we look forward to collaborations between central banks to grow their cashless societies, ala Thailand and Cambodia? Or would the collaborations veer towards inter-company collaborations?

Many observers predict coalescence and dominance of a few e-wallets in each country, which would be a fair assessment based on precedent. But with a whole region heading towards the same direction, there is a possibility that companies will coalesce across country borders as well. As it is, we don’t see Malaysia forming an e-wallet giant on its own, but it could still very well play a part in forming an inter-SEA e-wallet giant.

And that would be an interesting combo-breaker.

PT Tokopedia and PT Bukalapak.com will be among e-commerce companies which will ask sellers for identification numbers, known as NPWP, as a condition to operate on their platforms, according to Robert Pakpahan, the Finance Ministry’s director general of taxes. These platforms will submit a monthly report of transactions to the government, he said.

“We want to improve tax enforcement but we don’t want to scare the startups,” Pakpahan said in an interview in Jakarta. “Instead of the startups collecting taxes, their merchants will perform self-assessment on the arrears.”

President Joko Widodo is accelerating efforts to boost revenue to help finance billions of dollars in infrastructure projects as the economy struggles amid an emerging-market rout. Online shops have boomed in Indonesia with vendors offering goods from refrigerators to condoms to the latest iPhone, often without declaring incomes.

Online commerce sales in Indonesia will grow to as much as $65 billion in 2022 from $8 billion in 2017, McKinsey & Co. estimated. Bukalapak reported a 60 percent annual growth of its sellers in June and is signing up hundreds more mom-and-pop stores daily.

Starting in July, the government lowered the final income tax for micro, small and medium enterprises to 0.5 percent from 1 percent, and gave a transition period of as long as seven years before imposing normal rates.

Instagram Merchants

Merchants on social media like Instagram might be spared for now as “the enforcement won’t be as easy,” Pakpahan said on Sept. 28.

The government is also using information from banks to catch the big tax evaders, he said. Under the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) framework which was passed into law in August 2017, domestic banks share details of deposits of at least 1 billion rupiah ($66,000) with tax officials.

“If the deposits are big enough, I will be able to get the details of the bank accounts through the AEOI and inquire about the source of the money,” Pakpahan said. “That is why data management is very important.”

The government has allocated at least 3 trillion rupiah by 2025 to develop the infrastructure needed to improve its data management.

Indonesia has also started sharing information on tax and financial accounts with its AEOI partners, including Singapore and Switzerland, since last week.

The government aims to increase the tax-to-gross domestic product ratio to 13 percent by 2020 from a goal of 11.6 percent this year. It has projected that it will only collect about 95 percent of the tax revenue target of 1,424 trillion rupiah for this year.

43;792283623;20181005;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/24543/mobilepayments/payments-asia/;"In fintech’s genesis across Asia, it seemed like all of the new developments were focused on streamlining payments without coincidence, around the time that e-commerce experienced its boom too.

Now, that trend seems to be making a grand return with government bodies perking up to the idea of launching their own payments frameworks, not to mention the financial institutions that are jumping aboard payment tech innovations as well.

Successful early players are now enjoying a good period to grow and expand their operations.

Nearly 75% of Asian consumers use a smartphone, which lends well towards e-payments. Meanwhile, financial institutions and corporations are also drawn to the technology for its money-saving potential, and reduced labour is always a plus.

The cash-reliant lifestyle felt by many Asian countries lends well to the rise of payments fintech. In fact, it was this very reason that WeChat and Alipay rose to dominance in China—its citizens, many unbanked, happy to bid farewell to the cumbersome cash and embrace that cashless society.

Singapore is catching up to China, in parts thanks to the nation’s strong support of China’s Belt and Silk Road initative, and in other parts thanks to its strong and permissive fintech ecosystem.

A PwC report has also identified emerging markets, like many in the Asian market, spearheading some key developments in payments: payments through social media, NFC technology, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Blockchain-based payments. Similarly, while there is still a lot of ways that payments can evolve in this region, so too are the challenges that plague an uncertain market.

Where Everybody Stands Today

Notable Players

One cannot talk about payments in Asia without talking about Grab, following in China’s footsteps in hopes of launching a “super app” combining multiple functions like food delivery, online grocery shopping, bike-sharing and etc in hopes of pushing their e-wallet, GrabPay.

Southeast Asia’s other ride-hailing unicorn, Go-Jek from Indonesia, has also dabbled in digital payments thanks to a particularly fertile scene in Indonesia.

In their bid to strengthen their hold in payments, Go-Jek has already bought three fintech firms—Kartuku, an offline payments processing company, Midtrans, a popular online payment gateway, and Mapan, a savings and lendings network.

It also owns and runs the mobile wallet Go-Pay.

Meanwhile, China’s giants are attempting their own foray outside of the mainland, but with only a tentative eye on Southeast Asia. Ant Financial acquired $14 billion for a global expansion plan, but their Southeast Asian strategy is now more focused on making their services available to Chinese tourists—while partnering up with Malaysia’s Touch ‘N Go, a smart card geared for transportation payments, to develop their own TNG Wallet. Meanwhile WeChat Pay is making careful strides in their expansion and as of now, only Malaysians are able to use WeChat Pay in their local denomination.

Progress Across The Board

Singapore and Malaysia, both at different stages of a similar trajectory, is having a hard time getting onboard e-payments in favour of just swiping their cards—notable because both nations experience a relatively higher number of banked individuals compared to some other countries in the region. Singaporeans mostly pay using the Nets system, which has more recently opened their services for QR code payments. Other platforms in Singapore include PayNow and Dash.

Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the payments scene is only starting to rise, but what they lack in time they make up for in interesting moves. One of the more interesting new services recently is InstaPay, which allows SMEs or small businesses to accept payments via WhatsApp or line, instead of trying to apply for the difficult and pricey card terminals. Besides the growing number of mobile wallets that the nation prefers to call e-money,

There is also an InstaPay in the Philippines, but this service was launched by the country’s own central bank, the Banko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) in April. The electronic fund transfer platform aims for smooth interoperability between different banks, though as of 2017, the number of banks on board the system is still limited.

In the Philippines, payment fintech firms are still fighting for a more dominant spot, but some platforms we’ve identified as having high potential include GCash, PayMaya, and the good old Visa PayWave.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the country is experiencing an e-commerce wave, which has reportedly led to theft by delivery workers. As a result, its people are favouring the more secure e-payments, with messaging app Zalo gunning to launch Zalopay terminals, and early player MoMo eager to expand. Even the state-owned PetroVietnam Oil introduced mobile payments just earlier this year in a bid to capture the wave.

What The Governments Are Up To

Many governments across Southeast Asia are gunning hard for their nations to port over to digital payments, perhaps in no small part thanks to digital transactions being easier to regulate and control—not to mention the economic boost it could grant their people.

Interoperable Networks

This interest has led many of them to launch their own state-funded payments initiative. The aforementioned InstaPay by the Philippines central bank comes to mind, but many in particular have vested interest in some of Singapore’s most recent developments.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore recently launched the Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR), a QR network compatible with 27 e-payments providers in hopes of unifying the fragmented e-wallets in the island nation.

The regulator would also be issuing an interbank payment gateway, allowing both financial institutions and fintech firms quicker access to the nation’s Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) system to grow its cashless ecosystem.

Malaysia has also, in parts, looked to QR codes through its Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework (ICTF) framework. ICTF actually combines the aforementioned Singapore initiatives, aiming to both encourage interoperability to facilitate healthy competition, while also issuing a unified QR code network.

One of its more interesting plans is the Real-Time Retail Payment Platform, which aims to eventually link an account to unique identifiers like mobile numbers and identity card numbers to issue payments, as well as the aforementioned common QR code.

Cross-Country Collaborations

The Indonesian central bank has encouraged its populace to adopt a cashless society, and put their money where their mouth is through the development of the National Payment Gateway (NPG).

Its first phase in December last year focused oninfrastructure sharing between banks to cut the cost of interbank transactions and also reduce payment for toll road users. In March earlier this year, the central bank said that they were in the midst of phase two: for lenders to cut cross-bank transaction costs by streamlining the process.

The Bank of Thailand has initiated a cross-border fund transfer, in collaboration with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, which hopes to reduce the costs for migrant workers to transfer funds between regions.

Cambodia and Thailand have also joined forces to roll out a QR code payment system in 2019.

Tying Into Financial Institutions

These many efforts by central banks and regulators have had a healthy effect on large financial institutions.

For more traditional financial institutions and how they hold up in today’s race, Singapore and Thailand’s regulatory intervention allowed the nations to encourage real-time transfers, which grants many of these institutions a fighting chance compared to unaffiliated e-wallets. Many governments are also gunning hard for cutting down the prices of money transfers, has helped financial institutions stay ahead as well, like in Malaysia.

Challenges

There is a reason why many central banks are pushing hard for interconnectivity: it remains one of the key reasons that hinders their cashless society dreams through high fees and slow processing speeds. Incumbent infrastructures separated into their own silos also inhibits more nimble fintech movements and technology adoption.

Can The Populations Learn to Trust E-Payments?

There are also issues in trust.

Nations that are more familiar with money that you can actually see and touch are not very keen on going on e-payments, in fear of losing their hard-earned money through hacks and fraud.

Not to mention, some of them would prefer to stay unbanked to avoid anyone tracing their assets, or in many cases, simply lack the income to truly see the value of mobile payments.

Other nations that have a heavier card reliance may not see the benefits of abandoning that in lieu of e-payments. They already have access to benefits like discounts and cashback, so in these cases, a lot of e-money issuers offer rewards and discounts out of their own pockets to facilitate adoption.

Saturation: Potential or Drawback?

There is also the issue of too many e-wallets, which affects countries like Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

Too many options could potentially bog down the public’s interest in adoption as well, though we may see a silver lining in the future. Similar to the trajectory in China, we foresee mergers and partnerships coming in various payments battlegrounds and thus, consolidation into super companies leaving perhaps two or three strong players to duke it out in a specific region.

This is when the stiff competition in a specific region will truly start benefiting the country and lend to more innovations into e-payments.

On Their Own E-Payment Paths

Southeast Asia’s countries are now on an exciting journey into their own forms of cashless and e-payments, and it will be interesting to observe how the ecosystem will move. Could there be more inter-country collaborations in the future for the region, ala Thailand and Cambodia?

For now, many are anticipating an explosion in Indonesia and Philippines due to both countries’ high number of underserved populations, high smartphone penetration and both regions’ large population numbers with Indonesia clocking in 261.1 million in 2016, and Phillippines 103.3 million in the same year.

If you would like to gain a more comprehensive insight into individual regions, Fintech News releases a series of reports detailing a comprehensive list of players in specific countries. In Southeast Asia, we have published reports for Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.

ASIC commissioner John Price noted that he is interested in learning from the innovations taking place in the Grand Duchy. “We look forward to sharing ASIC’s experience with our Innovation Hub and regulatory sandbox initiatives,” he added.



Claude Marx, chief executive of the CSSF, added: “Australia and Luxembourg are both strongly innovation-oriented jurisdictions, and we do think that such agreement will enhance our ability to adapt ourselves to the upcoming FinTech challenges.”



In 2013, the regulators entered into memorandums of understanding on regulating entities that have presence in both Australia and Luxembourg, and specifically for funds management entities regulated under the EU’s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD).



This agreement is ASIC’s fifteenth FinTech cooperation agreement and the fourth information-sharing agreement, following agreements with China, Indonesia and Kenya.



Previous agreements have been signed with regulators in the UK, Hong Kong and Singapore."

Called CrowdFarmX, the startup will use smart contracts to connect farmers directly with wholesale distributors and retailers, helping them to gain a greater cut of the selling price.

Like many other food supply chain related blockchain platforms, CrowdFarm X’s platform will provide visibility of the agricultural supply chain to ensure food safety.

The startup will also equip farmers with technology knowhow, including the use of data analytics and internet-of-things (IoT) irrigation monitoring systems, to deliver higher-quantity and quality yields, potentially increasing net yield by up to 10 times and contributing towards global food sufficiency.

On the role of S/4 Hana Public Cloud, CrowdFarm X founder and CEO David Tan said the cloud-based suite will deliver “an intelligent and intuitive digital backbone that supports us to have more complete visibility of the supply chain and supports rapid scalability”.

Further, the startup will make use of the software’s enterprises resource planning (ERP) capabilities, from production planning and management of sales and distribution, to procurement and financial control.

The implementation is expected to go live in December 2018.

CrowdFarm X aims to attract 10 million Southeast Asian farmers to its platform in the next 22 years, starting with an initial goal to sign up 1,000 farmers in a pilot phase by 2020.

Its targets are bold, given that many supply-chain related blockchain applications are not yet proven in the market, along with the low technology adoption rates in the agriculture industry in Southeast Asia.

That said, the startup seems to have made some headway, having roped in partners to set up CrowdFarmX Food Cradle farming facilities in Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia, with Myanmar and Vietnam in the pipeline."

Answers to these questions and more were found at the much-anticipated Malaysia Rice Bowl Startup Awards 2018 that was held on 28th September at the Oasis Discovery Centre in Ara Damansara, Selangor.

Organised by the New Entrepreneurs Foundation Malaysia (myNEF) and now into its fourth year, the Malaysia Rice Bowl Startup Awards is the platform for recognising young startups disrupting old processes and industries.

A brainchild of myNEF, the awards recognise breakout startups in the country that harness digital technology, and celebrate rising tech entrepreneurs in various categories of excellence ranging from retail, media, digital, tech, products, services and innovative campaigns to women and social enterprises.

myNEF believes businesses can grow fast and be sustainable when they harness technology and knowledge.

It plays a significant role in bridging industry players and the government, working closely with various agencies and government-related organisations to support existing and upcoming entrepreneur development programmes.

The Malaysia Rice Bowl Startup Awards and ASEAN Rice Bowl Startup Awards are among myNEF's signature programmes.

The Rice Bowl Award (Rice Bowl) is beneficial to both the Malaysian startup and ASEAN startup ecosystems as it connects and empowers the ASEAN Economic Community to power up their local economies with startups and scaleups.

YB Tuan Gobind Singh Deo, Minister of Communications and Multimedia commented, ""I am extremely happy to hear that Malaysian Startups are accelerating faster than ever, and we hope that they become a significant contributor to our nation's GDP and growth, and also become a significant type of business that employs and cultivate cutting edge talent and become a key source of employment.""

Rice Bowl recognises innovation, excellence and best practice in startups and ecosystem players across ASEAN, as well as celebrates the ASEAN community's spirit of diversity in entrepreneurship to solve local rice bowl issues that are replicable across the region.

It also recognises the excitement, risk and hard work involved in developing a startup and the influence each person has on driving the success of their company.

myNEF believes that by celebrating startups, together they can solve the diverse local rice bowl issues faced by each country across Southeast Asia. This will ultimately benefit Malaysia and subsequently ASEAN as a region.

According to the Chief Executive Officer of myNEF, Lilyana Abdul Latiff, ""With over 50 nominations for Founder of the Year, and over 70 nominations for Startup of the Year at this year's Rice Bowl Startup Awards - I think Malaysia's Tech Startup Ecosystem has matured rapidly in the past 3 years. It is a testament to the developmental investments and programmes by the Malaysian government, private sector support and independent initiatives. For a modest market size, we should be on track to produce Malaysian-based 'Unicorns' within the next few years.""

The categories of the Malaysia Rice Bowl Startup Awards 2018 are Star Awards (Startup of the Year, Founder of the Year, Best Newcomer, People's Choice); and Industry Awards (Best Fintech, Best Health/Med Tech, Best Food & Agri Tech, Best e-Commerce, Best Logistics & Supply Chain, Best Business Automation Tool, Best Life Helper).

The other categories are Ecosystems Awards (Investor of the Year, Best Accelerator/Incubator Programme, Best Ecosystem Initiative, Best Co-working Space); and Cross Sector Awards (Best Digital Marketing, Best AI/Machine Learning, Best IoT).

Tokopedia to launch pay-later feature

Alibaba-backed e-commerce unicorn Tokopedia is launching a virtual credit card feature following the lead of fellow unicorns Traveloka and Go-Jek.

The feature called TokoSwipe, which is currently being launched in beta, gives users a choice of installment at 0% interest at up to 12 months tenor to purchase products from Tokopedia’s platform, from a minimum value of Rp 10,000.

TokoSwipe represents the latest financial technology feature developed by Tokopedia. The company has previously launched e-wallet feature, as well as mutual funds and gold investment products.

Recently, ride-hailing unicorn launched a similar feature called PayLater, developed by Mapan, one of the three fintech startups that the company acquired last year. Traveloka had earlier also launched a feature by the same name.

Founded in 2009, Tokopedia raised an investment round in 2014, where it received $100 million from SoftBank and Sequoia. Alibaba is a minority shareholder in the Tokopedia after the Chinese giant led a $1.1-billion investment round into the startup last year.

""We know we have to transform our business in bold and courageous ways and we’re starting that process now,"" Todd Putman told IntraFish. ""There is no lack of enthusiasm, engagement or ideas among the employees. We know we need profitable growth in both the short- and long-term, and everyone is onboard.""

Putman said recent leadership changes are providing Bumble Bee the opportunity to re-define its strategic plan.

Bumble Bee's former CEO Chris Lischewski stepped down in May following a US District Court decision that handed him a a one-count felony indictment, alleging he carried out a conspiracy by agreeing to fix the prices of packaged seafood during meetings and other communications.

Jan Tharp, who has served as the company's chief operating officer (COO) for the last six years, assumed the role of interim CEO of Bumble Bee following his departure.

That's one of the reasons Bumble Bee recently hired Bulldog Drummond, a San Diego-based creative and design agency, to guide the iconic tuna company through a strategic transformation that Putman said ""will roll out over the next year and help reposition our organization for success through identifying long-term vision and growth strategies to guide brand identity, company culture and future innovations and/or potential acquisitions.""

Former Bumble Bee CEO aims to dismiss price fixing lawsuit

Putman didn't go into detail about future changes to Bumble Bee's company culture or potential acquisitions but did acknowledge it will be ""something bigger in the near future that will excite, engage and motivate our employees, business partners and customers.""

In the low margin competitive canned tuna business, Bumble Bee has looked for ways to expand its product range and revenue streams.

Three years ago, Bumble Bee Seafoods-owned Anova Food launched the world’s first Fair Trade certified seafood product – Indonesia artisanal handline caught yellowfin tuna – in US grocery stores. In 2013 the company entered the frozen seafood world with its SuperFresh brand, a once-frozen, all-natural line with no coloring, no preservatives and five to eight ingredients.

Bumble Bee Foods' Senior VP of Marketing and Corporate Social Responsibility Dave Melbourne said canned and pouch tuna is well positioned to grow at Tuna 2018 in Bangkok in late May.

In 2016 Bumble Bee's branded portfolio of canned solid white albacore tuna in water and in oil became Non-GMO Project Verified.

Alongside brand innovations and sustainability efforts, Bumble Bee has been battling the backlash of a price-fixing scandal since 2015, when a grocery cooperative filed a lawsuit against major manufacturers that included the company.

""Stay tuned because a core part of our go forward business plan will include an enhanced commitment to changing our world in a way that is relevant and meaningful to our employees and customers,"" Putman said."

Venture capital firm Sequoia India, which led Moka’s Series B round of $24 million in September, played matchmaker for the acquisition of the firm legally named as Focus Analytics Pvt. Ltd.

Prateek Chaturvedi, co-founder and chief executive of GetFocus, told TechCircle, “We were in talks with Sequoia for a Series A round and were given an option to work with Moka.” The IIT-Bombay graduate added, “The GetFocus product will help Moka drive retail intelligence as an add-on product to its PoS software.” Chaturvedi and co-founder and tech chief Manoj Gudi, who set up GetFocus in 2013, will be joining Moka at Jakarta. Gudi is an electrical and electronics engineer from the University of Mumbai.

GetFocus uses wireless analytics to collect data on customer walk-in, targeted marketing and notifications. The company, which has worked with ticketing platform BookMyShow, HDFC Bank and more, has shut its India operations to focus on Moka’s clients in Indonesia.

“We will be setting up the technology office for Moka in Bengaluru with 15 to 20 people to begin with. This is part of a larger trend as companies look at India technology centres due to the ready availability of talent,” said Chaturvedi.

GetFocus had raised $500,000 in two tranches from high net worth individuals and registered a client base of 10 million users on its platform. The product from GetFocus helps businesses increase customer walk-ins and revenue, decrease cost, and build brands, said Chaturvedi.

Moka chief executive Haryanto Tanjo said in a statement, “Moka has been growing very rapidly in the past, and we have more than 12,000 merchants using us everyday.” The executive added, “We realised the need to have a very strong technology and research arm in India, and acquiring GetFocus helps us strengthen our technology excellence and leadership and bring the best services for your customers.”

Founded in 2014 by Tanjo and Grady Laksmono, Moka provides a PoS application and an integrated digital payment solution. It also offers loyalty programmes for repeat customers, tracks inventory and customer feedback and compiles intelligence on best-selling items and busiest hours."

51;790519487;20180928;2018;https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/gojek-bukalapak-indonesia-fintech-107558/;"The huge opportunities within the financial technology sector in Indonesia have prompted some of the unicorns in the country to aggressively extend financial services to seize the mouthwatering market.

On Thursday, ride-hailing firm Go-Jek, the first of the country’s unicorns to delve into the financial technology space through its e-wallet and payment service Go-Pay, launched a new payment feature called PayLater that enables customers wanting to purchase laptops, smartphones and other goods to pay in interest-free instalments for up to a certain limit.

The feature is a lending product developed by Mapan, one of the three fintech startups that Go-Jek acquired last year.

For now, the lending feature will only be available selectively to Go-Food customers who meet certain criteria, the company said in a release.

By launching the PayLater feature, Go-Jek is following a move carried out earlier by travel startup and fellow unicorn Traveloka, which in June rolled out an identical feature – also called PayLater – which was developed in partnership with local fintech firm Danamas.

The launch of Go-Jek’s Paylater coincided with another significant fintech move by another of the country’s unicorn, Bukalapak.

The online commerce company announced the launch of its e-wallet feature, which it says is part of its vision to empower small and medium enterprises in Indonesia.

The BukaDana e-wallet, which is a result of Bukalapak’s collaboration with Emtek and Ant Financial-backed digital wallet firm DANA, is the latest product in the Indonesian firm’s expansion into financial services.

The company, which started off as a pure e-commerce company in 2010, has in the last few years launched a number of different online financial services including financial products like loans, credit and insurance, as well as mutual fund and gold investments.

Bukalapak had previously launched its very own e-wallet called BukaDompet, but it was partly on hold for the past year as the Indonesian firm struggled to obtain an e-money license from Bank Indonesia. BukaDana, Bukalapak told reporters, will offer part of the function of BukaDompet, but may not necessarily replace it altogether.

Bukalapak is not the only startup having to face a lengthy wait for their e-money feature to be given the green light by the country’s central bank. Fellow e-commerce unicorn Tokopedia also has yet to obtain a license for its TokoCash feature, despite it being under Bank Indonesia’s assessment for over a year.

The company has said that it will partner with numerous fintech firms to provide payment options for customers as it continues to wait for the license to be issued.

The suspension of some of the payment platforms offered by non-fintech companies in the county was carried out by Bank Indonesia in September 2017 due to regulatory issues and has even affected Singapore-headquartered giants Grab and Shopee.

However, the tide might finally start to be turning for these companies after Shopee, a subsidiary of regional unicorn Sea Group, very recently had its e-money feature approved by the Central Bank.

Last week, Sea Group announced that it has obtained a Bank Indonesia e-money license granted to its subsidiary AirPay, which will later be applied to Shopee Pay.

52;790552098;20180928;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/24327/mobilepayments/grabpay-philippines/;"When Grab announced that they wanted to take a stake in e-payments, many made the comparisons to Tencent’s Alibaba. That was no coincidence. After acquiring Uber (and a potential monopoly) in the Southeast Asian region, Grab has come out with their ambition to become an everyday app.

Almost in rapid succession, Grab comes out with other offerings—Grabfood, a partnership with an online grocery shopper, its various shuttle services, GrabBike, GrabCycle (emulating the now-defunct oBike) all while continuously pushing the extension underlying it all, GrabPay.

Now it has come out that Grab has its eye on the Philippines.

Grab Has Secured an E-Money License for a Mobile Wallet in the Philippines.

With blessing from the Filipino regulator Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the ride-hailing company will be able to expand its GrabPay wallet into the Filipino market soon—which would encompass bill payments, in-store purchases and access to its multitudes of services that will no doubt follow.

The Philippines will be joining the likes of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam as a recipient of the company’s app—and Grab is strategic in its choice of regional expansion.

Vietnam’s Prime Minister has greenlit a cashless project that hopes to reduce the ratio of cash transactions to below 10%.

Malaysia’s central bank has issued the Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework (ICTF) seeking to foster a more innovative payment landscape while Indonesia is constantly rethinking its e-money regulations to better keep up with industry needs.

Without coincidence, all of these markets have been described as fertile ground for e-wallets to flourish—and the same applies to the Philippines.

Its Philippine Opportunities and Challenges

BSP in February accredited 3 separate e-money issuers, while in June, it is said that more industry players are expected to start using Instapay, which is said in turn will drive up the volume of e-money transfers, payments and managements by the Philippine Payments Management Inc. (PPMI).

The Philippines is uniquely positioned for e-wallets to thrive, because according to BSP, 77% of Filipinos remain unbanked.

Lack of funds is a huge issue that the Philippines needs to grapple with for its populace, but besides that, 18% of respondents cite lack of documentation as a barrier to opening a bank account, while others mention the high cost of opening a bank account, lack of knowledge, joblessness and lack of awareness as reasons behind their unbanked state.

E-wallets, with the right expansion strategy, could be the great equaliser that grants Filipinos access to financial services otherwise reserved for banked populations—and grants them opportunities in the global digital economy.

The problem though is that despite regulatory and industry push, the same report by BSP records that only 1.3% of adults have an e-money account, taking into account that one person may have several accounts on different platforms.

Not only will Grab have to invest a significant amount of labour and cash into educating the populace about e-wallets, we think that the high number of Filipinos without access to funds will put Grab in a relatively more difficult position as well. It remains unclear if Grab has goals towards ubiquity of its app in the Phillippines, but if it does, the company will have to sweeten the pot and give the poorer Filipinos reasons to adopt their app.

Nevertheless, Grab remains optimistic.

Ooi Huey Tyng, Managing Director of GrabPay Malaysia, reportedly stated:

“The convenience of Grab’s many services and the millions of customers already using the Grab app every day, make us confident about the GrabPay wallet’s prospects. With the support from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we can now help millions participate in the cashless, digital economy without the need for a bank account or to download additional apps.”

Business Mirror reports that Grab Philippines will be launching its GrabPay services on October 8th, and similar to how it did it in other regions, all users of the base Grab app will automatically receive it in their mobile devices with an update. Ooi Huey said that half the smartphones in the region has the Grab app downloaded.

It will be interesting to observe if Grab will go with the money-bleeding cashback method that many wallets in the Southeast Asian region seems to be going for, or if it will be emulating any strategies already employed in other regions."

Online airline ticketing and hotel booking service Traveloka received $350 million from US-based travel company Expedia, while e-commerce website Bukalapak received an undisclosed amount from 500 American startups and QueensBridge Venture Partners. Tokopedia, another e-commerce site, meanwhile received $1.1 billion from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.

Over the long run, this means profit would be transferred to the investors' countries, leading to an even larger current-account deficit, further increasing pressure on the rupiah.

Bhima Yudhistira Adhinegara, an economist at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef), warned that most of the startups still experience losses but foreign funding keeps pouring in, driving up their valuations.

""Once the valuation is at its peak, they would sell their shares for a capital gain,"" Bhima said.

These startups are also well placed to harvest customer data, paving the way for foreign investors to gain a foothold in Indonesia's tightly regulated payment and credit ecosystem.

""It can be seen from Go-Jek that expanded its wings into a payment system. Companies such as Alipay and WeChat Pay could enter Indonesia by funding local startups with the intention to expand their scope in fintech,"" Bhima said.

""Don't let them being too liberal like banks. If necessary, it might be better to introduce special regulations, such as limiting foreign ownership to 40 percent and requiring collaboration with domestic capital for the remainder,"" he added.

Johnny Darmawan, deputy chairman for industrial affairs at the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin), agreed with Bhima's assessment.

""They aim for consumer data; that's why they keep investing in the startups,"" Johnny said.

He also questioned the fact that despite attracting huge amounts of capital, startups are still categorized as small and medium enterprises, preventing the government from imposing limits on foreign funding.

""Also, startups are often out of the tax authority's scope; that's why we must find a way to tax those that are funded by foreign entities,"" Johnny said.

Technology expert Heru Sutadi, a former commissioner of the Indonesian Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (BRTI), said it would be a great danger to share citizens' data with foreign entities, as it is prone to abuse.

""Citizens will be the victims. The user data belongs to citizens, while it is being exploited,"" he said.

The Financial Services Authority (OJK) banned hundreds of illegal foreign online lenders this year after a series of user-data abuses surfaced.

Still, other businesses beg to give startups more opportunities, pointing out that Indonesia's digital economy is still in its infancy.

""Just let startups develop. But if they start to cause chaos in economy and make no contribution to it, they must be disciplined,"" said Chris Kanter, secretary of the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo). He believes the current size of foreign investment in local startups is still normal.

Shinta Kamdani, deputy chairwoman for international relations at Kadin, said that instead of limiting foreign investment, more startups should be encouraged to list on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) to allow them to attract more local investors."

In an official release, Venturra said the new fund, Venturra Discovery, aims to fill a gap brought about by the decrease in the number of early-stage funding channels in Southeast Asia.

The fund plans to invest in 30-40 startups over the next four years, with check sizes ranging from $200,000-500,000.

DEALSTREETASIA had first reported in August about Venturra’s plan to launch a new seed fund.

Venturra Capital, which counts Ruangguru, Zilingo, Sociolla and Happy Fresh among its portfolio companies, primarily invested in mid-stage companies in its previous fund. The VC firm said it aims to share insights derived from its past investments to nurture early-stage companies.

To date, Venturra Discovery has backed three companies and is looking to invest in more.

Venturra Capital was founded by former Rocket Internet Southeast Asia MD Stefan Jung, former Google Indonesia country manager Rudy Ramawy and Lippo Group executive director John Riady in 2015 and launched its $150-million first fund in the same year.

The new seed fund will see the involvement of new partner Raditya Pramana, who will run the fund alongside Ramawy and Riady. Jung, meanwhile, will sit on the Advisory Board of Venturra Discovery, while managing Venturra Fund I.

Raditya brings experience in seed investments gained at IMJ Investment Partners, where he led investments in companies such as Kudo (exited to Grab), Fabelio, and Kata.ai and was also involved in investments such as Bukalapak.

Venturra’s backer Lippo is a pan-Asian group with strategic investments and operations across eight markets globally. It is the largest integrated services group in Indonesia, serving more than 60 million customers across its real estate, malls, department stores, hospitals, telecommunications, media and financial services businesses.

55;790022658;20180926;2018;https://www.forest-trends.org/ecosystem_marketplace/indonesias-sustainable-districts-bet-on-corporate-deforestation-pledges/;"Beni Hernedi loves mountain-climbing, and he bristles when people dismiss his passion.

“They think it’s about thrill-seeking and cheating death,” he says. “But for me it’s the opposite; it’s about being out in nature, living life to its fullest, and making sure that everything is done with meticulous preparation and safety.”

Those habits got him elected vice regent, or Vice Bupati, for the administrative district of Musi Banyuasin, in South Sumatra, Indonesia, where he developed his current passion: sustainable development.

It’s a calling he received during the 2015 wildfires that left swathes of his district in cinders and filled the lungs of people as far away as Singapore and Malaysia – where, ironically, many of the companies responsible for the devastation were located.

“These fires started because our farmers were clearing forest to grow palm oil,” he says. “But our farmers were selling to companies in Singapore, and sometimes working for them directly, and it hit me that we have a shared responsibility to address this.”

Indonesian attorney Gita Syahrani agreed, and today the two are among the leading force of something called the Sustainable Districts Association (Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari in Indonesian, or “LTKL”), which unites administrative districts that are scattered across Indonesia in a coordinated effort to better manage their forests, farms, and fields. Research shows that these activities can get the world 37 percent of the way to meeting the Paris Climate targets, but they attract just 3 percent of climate finance.

The LTKL aims to bridge the funding gap by creating districts that can attract investment capital – in part by establishing long-term uptake agreements with companies that want to comply with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the United Nations created in 2015 to drive finance into clean development.

2015: The Great Confluence

The 193 countries of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the SDGs three years ago – on September 25, 2015 – three months after the wildfires had begun engulfing Southeast Asia and two weeks after South Sumatra had declared a state of emergency.

It was the lead-up to the year-end climate talks in Paris, and Indonesia had already pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by slowing deforestation – a pledge that was formalized in its climate action plan, or Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) to the climate challenge when the Paris Agreement was adopted in December.

“All of this stuff was happening at once,” says Hernedi. “The national government had its NDC, which we wanted to support, and it has also adopted the SDGs, which seemed like a way to get finance flowing into the district to support sustainability, and the wildfires were a real wake-up call, so I started looking for entry points into these processes.”

That’s when he learned of another initiative that had begun one year earlier – the New York Declaration on Forests (NYDF), which is a non-binding agreement to cut the global rate of deforestation in half by 2020 and end it by 2030. The NYDF focuses on four commodities responsible for most of the world’s deforestation – namely, beef, soy, palm oil and pulp & paper.

“In my district, palm oil was the big problem,” he says. “And most of the signatories were active here.”

Indeed, three of the NYDF signatories – Golden Agri, Musim Mas, and Wilmar – were located in Singapore, while one was in Malaysia (Sime Darby), one was in Indonesia (Asian Agri), and all had interests in or near his district.

More importantly, all five of these regional players were members of a global sustainability network called the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA2020), which was created to help businesses, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) meet the 2020 targets.

Hernedi started attending regional meetings, where he learned that TFA 2020 had scheduled its first General Assembly for March, 2016, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.

There, he found other Bupatis who shared the same goals – and faced many of the same challenges.

The Challenge

Indonesia’s Bupatis often get blamed for the country’s rapid deforestation, which kicked in after the fall of President Suharto in 1998. Authority over forests was then decentralized, so Bupatis started granting forest-development concessions to fund their local economies and, sometimes, line their own pockets.

The 2015 fires, coupled with the advent of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, may have sparked an awakening among some, but sustainability-oriented Bupatis found themselves in a quandary.

“Sustainable development is a long-term endeavor, but Bupatis only serve for five years,” says Hernedi. “Also, any budgetary allocation for forest conservation is handled by federal or provincial authorities who don’t always understand what’s needed on the ground.”

In a forested rural economy, the challenge of sustainable development becomes a challenge of sustainable agriculture and forest management – which requires changing practices and managing expectations.

“We can talk about getting certified under, say, the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standard or the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), but that requires up-front investment and education,” says Hernedi. “We need help with that, and I need to be able to offer my people, the smallholders in particular, some sort of assurances that their efforts will be rewarded.”

Coming Together

When Hernedi met Syahrani in 2016, she was working as the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Sustainable Commodity & Business Manager for Indonesia – a position she’d taken after acting as the private-sector liaison for the National REDD+ Agency, which was a body tasked with helping the country dock with international climate agreements around forestry.

“I’d been working with the districts to develop their green growth vision, and that gave me a chance to see how committed they were,” says Syahrani. “That was part of a program that wound down in 2016, and the Bupatis invited me out for a goodbye dinner.”

It didn’t, however, feel like goodbye, as the conversation swirled around the endless possible linkages between district green growth plans, the country’s climate change strategy, and global demand for deforestation-free commodities.

The next day, Syahrani got a call from Hernedi asking if they could keep the conversation going.

“Up to then, we’d been focused on palm oil, because so many companies had commitments in that commodity,” says Hernedi. “We realized, however, that we could cooperate on other commodities as well, but that it’s also strategic to have a caretaker help put this together, and Gita seemed like the perfect person for that.”

Syahrani floated the idea with three organizations: the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), the Indonesia Palm Oil Smallholders Association (SPKS), and the Indonesian Association of District Governments (APKASI) and found enough support to arrange a two-day workshop in December, 2016.

“We were all working pro-bono, but had enough money to get some meeting rooms,” she says. “Then we invited 15 districts to participate, and eight of them sent delegations.”

The districts, it turned out, had well-developed but extremely varied development programs.

“We had a rigorous discussion around core principles, and agreed that balance was key – that growth and environmental conservation and social welfare should all have equal footing.”

Indonesians have a word for that kind of balance: “lestari”, which means “keeping things as they are” but implies balance, preservation, and sustainability. They quickly settled on a name: Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari.

“It’s new kind of jurisdictional program – one that’s spread across eight founding districts that are themselves spread across the country,” says Syahrani. “LTKL is important because it’s being developed from the bottom up, at the most basic level of Indonesian government, rather than from the top down.”

LTKL was formally incorporated in partnership with APKASI by July 2017 and Syahrani formally switched gear to head the LTKL Secretariat. By September, 2017, LTKL participated in its first TFA 2020 Implementation Dialogue. There, Hernedi was one of the key speakers, providing an opportunity to learn directly from global trading groups what companies need from – and can offer – the districts.

That dialogue has since led to trial purchases from smallholders, and a subsequent meeting led to cooperation on fire prevention in peatlands.

Meanwhile, his district has found synergies with several other districts – most notably the district of Sigi in Central Sulawesi, 70 percent of which is protected forest that must be conserved.

“They were having trouble developing a business case for forest management, and we offered to help them make their case to at the national level through LTKL,” says Hernedi. “They have a competitive edge from the beginning with their strong commitment on agrarian reform and agrarian conflict resolution.”

Learning from Sigi, Hernedi has also set up a specific task force to help his district deal with agrarian reform and agrarian conflict resolution – a critical building block before any investment to further support sustainable development can start flowing. In parallel, LTKL has also helped Sigi and other members get involved in national discussions on better fiscal policy to support sustainable districts.

LTKL is hardly alone. Mayaysia’s Sabah Province is well on the way to becoming a sustainable jurisdiction, and IDH is working with several other provinces across Indonesia, while Brazil’s Green Municipalities are striving to attract international companies that have pledged to purge deforestation from their supply chains. In each case, local people and authorities have bet on those companies keeping their promises, and now the question is: will they?"

Jakarta, (ANTARA News) - Rapid technological advancements have enabled Indonesia to boost the development of its digital-based businesses, startup firms, and unicorn companies, thus projected to become Southeast Asia`s biggest digital economy in 2020.



In the development of startup companies, for instance, Indonesia is ranked fourth in the world, with 1,720 startups. Following the success, Indonesia is eager to transform startups into unicorns, pioneer firms, with valuation of at least US$1 billion.



Until now, Indonesia is the biggest country in Southeast Asia in terms of unicorn development. Of the only seven unicorn firms in Southeast Asia, four belong to Indonesia.



This places Indonesia in the fourth rank in the development of unicorns at par with Germany.



According to Communications and Information Technology Minister Rudiantara, entering a digital-based economy, Indonesia is fortunate to have several large startups called unicorns.



The achievements of young Indonesians are able to carve out a legacy or inheritance at an international level that is not only sweet to remember but also serves as an inspiration to other children of the nation.



""The so-called unicorn, with a proud performance, contributes significantly to the nation`s economy,"" he noted.



Rudiantara remarked that the startup in question was not one only built for fun by youngsters, but it must be seriously developed to become a unicorn. This is because at present, countries in the world are competing to attract foreign direct investment for startups.



""Indonesia is among the luckiest to be the target of world-class startup investors. The results can already be seen. Indonesia is one of the countries with a large number of unicorns growing rapidly,"" he noted.



Rudiantara expressed hope that Indonesian youth, who in 2030 will become a demographic bonus, would start contemplating on ways to become startup entrepreneurs and no longer restrict their scope to solely becoming chief executive officers, who are basically highest-ranking executives in companies.



""I do not want our nation with young people aspiring only to become employees but how to create business and provide work. Hence, we encourage young entrepreneurs to develop what is called startup,"" Minister Rudiantara emphasized.



He remarked that Indonesian startups are currently growing rapidly, flexing their muscles to the world, with remarkable achievements, and are also comparable to several unicorns in Germany.



""Not only in terms of unicorns, even in terms of startups, Indonesia has demonstrated its clout,"" Rudiantara noted while delivering a public lecture on Nationalism in the Digital Era at the IPB Dramaga Campus, Bogor, West Java, Monday (Sept. 24).



Based on data from the startup rankings until March 2018, Indonesia ranked fourth in the world in terms of the number of startups. The United States ranked first, with some 28 thousand startups; India, with 4,700; Britain, three thousand; and Indonesia, at around 1,720 startups.



Thus, Indonesian startups are expected to develop further and transform themselves into unicorn firms. Based on international data on unicorns, as of 2017, of the 359 startup unicorns in the world, China ranked first, with 149 unicorns; outperforming the United States, with only 146 unicorns, followed by Britain, India, and Israel.



""Indonesia is at par with Germany, as we have four unicorns. In the ASEAN, there are seven unicorns, four of which are in Indonesia, and three in our neighboring countries,"" he pointed out.



However, he remarked that two unicorns of the neighboring countries had Indonesia as their main market. Hence, the minister believes it is highly likely that in 2019, Indonesia will add another unicorn.



The development of startups in the country is apparent from the development of Traveloka, Bukalapak, Go-jeck, and Tokopedia, which are online service and commerce firms. These firms are able to develop fast, with valuations reaching trillions of rupiah in a relatively short period.



According to Rudiantara, Indonesian pioneer companies, which will become unicorn firms, will reach more than five in 2019. Moreover, until now, there are already four unicorn firms: Traveloka, Bukalapak, Go-jek, and Tokopedia.



""Now there are four unicorns, and the government believes that in 2019, there will be more than five unicorns, especially with the `next Indonesia unicorn` program that brings together a feasible startup with potential investors,"" he stated.



The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) will collect investment data received by several digital startup companies following the huge influx of news on capital injected by several giant companies in local startups.



""If we look at the announcement from e-commerce or startup companies, there were several of them. They hit trillions of investments and even tens of trillions, but this figure is still not being reflected in our database,"" BKPM Head Thomas Trikasih Lembong stated at the presentation on investment realization in 2017 in Jakarta early this year.



Minister of Industry Airlangga Hartarto, who attended the World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos, Switzerland, recently stated that the Indonesian government is focusing on cooperation with various parties to work together to grow startups that could become unicorns in Indonesia.



""Hence, there is a linked match program for entrepreneurs from startups,"" he explained.



The Industry Ministry has always encouraged the development of domestic startups, especially those supporting the digital industry sector. Moreover, digital technology continues to develop.



The government projects Indonesia to become Southeast Asia`s largest digital economy by 2020 by targeting thousand technopreneurs, business valuations of up to $100 billion, and a total e-commerce value of $130 billion.



""Its backbone is an applicable research center, such as Techno Park,"" Minister Hartarto stated.



The minister believes that with a large population reaching 262 million, Indonesia can maintain the potential of digital economy in future in line with the development of technology and social media. The penetration of internet users in Indonesia has reached 133 million people, or some 50 percent of the total population.



Furthermore, active users of social media reach 115 million people, or about 44 percent of the total population. The use of smartphones has also reached 371 million, or 141 percent of the total population.

The rapid growth of online business has slowed the shopping centre real estate market; however, experts say it has also provided a boost for the office rental market.

Despite heavy advertising to attract tenants, many commercial centres have still found it hard to attract brick-and-mortar stores. As a result, some shopping centres are being used for office space rather than retail establishments.

Some real estate specialists say the shopping centre slowdown is due to the e-commerce boom.

Pham Hung Thang, a lecturer at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Finance and Marketing, told Dau tu chung khoan (Securities Investment) newspaper that Vietnam had room for more e-commerce development thanks to the high level of Internet use among its population.

The number of Internet users in the country is expected to reach nearly 60 million in the next four years, and e-commerce is expected to grow at an annual rate of 30% to 50%. The development of smart phones and e-wallet technologies has contributed to this growth.

Experts worry that online purchases will supplant in-person transactions and make it hard for commercial centres to stay in business.

For example, the Pearl Plaza Commercial Centre in Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City has seen its number of vacancies rise, while none of the fifth floor of Van Hanh Mall is leased.

The office space real estate segment, meanwhile, has benefited from the rise of e-commerce.

According to a report by CBRE Vietnam, rental prices in HCM City office buildings have continuously increased. Third-quarter prices across the board were higher than in the previous quarter.

A-grade office rent posted a third quarter increase of 7%, representing a 17% annual rise. New buildings are being fully leased very quickly, causing a shortage and driving up prices. B-grade office rent also increased, rising 7.3% over the previous year.

Monthly rent for A-grade office space was US$43 per square metre, while B-grade office space went for US$23 per square metre. Office vacancy rates remained below 5%.

Another study by commercial real estate development firm JLL Vietnam showed most of the new renters are IT companies. The study predicts technology groups will occupy 15% to 25% of total rentable office space within the next decade, representing a huge increase over the 5% to 10% they occupied over the past three years.

Five years ago, HCM City had the third most technology companies of any city in the region, trailing only Manila and Singapore.

Things have changed over the past three years. HCM City has surpassed Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Singapore to attract the most technology firms of any city in the region.

“Nowhere is the technology sector’s increasing demand for office space more evident than in Vietnam,” said Stephen Wyatt, general manager of JLL Vietnam. “The country is catching up with the rapid development of other regional markets thanks to its young, dynamic, tech-savvy business people.”

“We have seen a significant increase in demand from technology and co-working companies over the past three years and expect this trend to continue over the next five years,"" he said.

JLL recently began advertising a 10,000 sqm e-commerce office space in HCM City, the largest office leasing transaction the city has seen in a decade.

A representative of JLL said the selection criteria for office space were influenced by factors such as potential government support and convenience for clients.

These elements constitute an ecosystem that is conducive to the development of start-up businesses. In big cities, tech companies are focused on finding office space in prominent buildings, close to public transport and integrated with the city. They want employees to live, work and play nearby.

These companies are often the first to lease the latest buildings.

Technology companies have become an important group of tenants, and investors and developers need to build new office space to keep pace with demand.

Technology companies are always looking for high quality office space to attract talent. Director of market research for JLL South-East Asia Regina Lim says developers need to consider the needs of their customers.

Integrating flexible co-working space can boost demand for an office building.

Flexible work space has increased by 40% annually over the past three years and currently accounts for 2% of the area’s office space, up from 0.5% in 2015.

Lim says this is because technology groups are always looking for a sustainable business environment and are supported by strong economic and social perspectives.

Over the next decade, e-commerce and flexible co-working space will continue to dominate the market. As e-commerce companies expand, online gaming and e-sports companies could be the next group of tenants to fill offices in Jakarta, Bangkok, Manila and HCM City. — Viet Nam News/Asia News Network"

According to a report by CBRE Viet Nam, rental prices in HCM City office buildings have continuously increased. Third-quarter prices across the board were higher than in the previous quarter.

A-grade office rent posted a third quarter increase of 7 per cent, representing a 17 per cent annual rise. New buildings are being fully leased very quickly, causing a shortage and driving up prices. B-grade office rent also increased, rising 7.3 per cent over the previous year.

Monthly rent for a-grade office space was US$43 per square metre, while B-grade office space went for $23 per square metre. Office vacancy rates remained below 5 per cent.

Another study by commercial real estate development firm JLL Viet Nam showed most of the new renters are IT companies. The study predicts technology groups will occupy 15 to 25 per cent of total rentable office space within the next decade, representing a huge increase over the 5 to 10 per cent they occupied over the past three years.

Five years ago, HCM City had the third most technology companies of any city in the region, trailing only Manila and Singapore.

Things have changed over the past three years. HCM City has surpassed Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Singapore to attract the most technology firms of any city in the region.

“Nowhere is the technology sector’s increasing demand for office space more evident than in Viet Nam,” said Stephen Wyatt, general manager of JLL Viet Nam. “The country is catching up with the rapid development of other regional markets thanks to its young, dynamic, tech-savvy business people.”

“We have seen a significant increase in demand from technology and co-working companies over the past three years and expect this trend to continue over the next five years,"" he said.

JLL recently began advertising a 10,000 sq.m e-commerce office space in HCM City, the largest office leasing transaction the city has seen in a decade.

A representative of JLL said the selection criteria for office space were influenced by factors such as potential Government support and convenience for clients.

These elements constitute an ecosystem that is conducive to the development of start-up businesses. In big cities, tech companies are focused on finding office space in prominent buildings, close to public transport and integrated with the city. They want employees to live, work and play nearby.

These companies are often the first to lease the latest buildings.

Technology companies have become an important group of tenants, and investors and developers need to build new office space to keep pace with demand.

Technology companies are always looking for high quality office space to attract talent. Director of market research for JLL South East Asia Regina Lim says developers need to consider the needs of their customers.

Integrating flexible co-working space can boost demand for an office building.

Flexible work space has increased by 40 per cent annually over the past three years and currently accounts for 2 per cent of the area’s office space, up from 0.5 per cent in 2015.

Lim says this is because technology groups are always looking for a sustainable business environment and are supported by strong economic and social perspectives.

Over the next decade, e-commerce and flexible co-working space will continue to dominate the market. As e-commerce companies expand, online gaming and e-sports companies could be the next group of tenants to fill offices in Jakarta, Bangkok, Manila and HCM City."

Despite heavy advertising to attract tenants, many commercial centres have still found it hard to attract brick-and-mortar stores. As a result, some shopping centres are being used for office space rather than retail establishments.

Some real estate specialists say the shopping centre slowdown is due to the e-commerce boom.

Pham Hung Thang, a lecturer at the HCM City University of Finance and Marketing, told Dau tu chung khoan (Securities Investment) newspaper Viet Nam had room for more e-commerce development thanks to the high level of internet use among its population.

The number of internet users in the country is expected to reach nearly 60 million in the next four years, and e-commerce is expected to grow at an annual rate of 30 to 50 per cent. The development of smart phones and e-wallet technologies has contributed to this growth.

Experts worry that online purchases will supplant in-person transactions and make it hard for commercial centres to stay in business.

Some of the profiles even indicate that the maids have been ""sold"".

SRC Recruitment under probe by MOM and could face prosecution if it has broken the law

The employment agency that ""sold"" maids on the online retail platform Carousell has had its licence suspended.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it had established that employment agency SRC Recruitment was behind the maid advertisements.

It added that the agency was served with a notice of licence suspension, and can no longer deploy any new foreign domestic workers (FDWs) for employment. MOM also said it was investigating the agency, with the view to prosecuting it for infringements under the Employment Agencies Act (EAA).

The suspension will remain in place for as long as investigations are ongoing, the ministry said.

Commissioner for Employment Agencies Kevin Teoh said: ""We strongly condemn the advertising of FDW services in an undignified manner. Advertising FDWs on an Internet platform meant for trading goods is completely inappropriate and unacceptable. Such an act is an offence under the EAA.""

MOM takes a serious view of the matter and will not hesitate to prosecute errant agencies, he added.

In a Facebook post yesterday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the ads that marketed maids.

She wrote: ""It pains me to think that our FDWs, many of whom are someone's daughter, sister and possibly even mother, are being marketed in such a manner.

""It is a given that we should treat them with respect.""

MOM was first alerted to the Carousell listings last Friday, and put up a Facebook post to warn other agencies against engaging in such practices. It also told Carousell to take down the offending posts.

""The ministry sternly warns employment agencies against similar actions that would denigrate the dignity of FDWs working in Singapore,"" said the MOM statement.

The ministry added that it is in touch with the Indonesian Embassy, and has informed it about the investigations.

The Carousell listings were posted by user @maid.recruitment and showed the faces of several maids, who are believed to be from Indonesia. Some of the posts indicated that the maids had been ""sold"". The postings prompted the Indonesian Embassy to say it would request a thorough investigation.

According to the Jakarta Post, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's overseas citizen protection director Lalu Muhammad Iqbal on Sunday said Indonesia's embassy in Singapore had voiced concerns about the practice to MOM.

New Zealand’s ad tech start-up Postr announces significant international growth with major telecom partners including Telkomsel, Telefonica and Altice

Wellington’s four year old ad-tech start-up Postr has experienced rapid global growth through partnerships with three top international telecoms, a doubling of its staff to 25 and a quadrupling of monthly revenue over the past 6 months.

Postr’s white label apps, which allow content generators and advertisers to connect with consumers on their smartphone lock screens and lets telecoms unlock free data for their customers, is proving a winner as the company approaches a NZ$2million annual recurring revenue run-rate this quarter.

Its Founder and CEO, former advertising creative Milan Reinartz, who recently made the Forbes 30 under 30 Asia list, is proud of his company’s significant global growth over a short period of time, bridging two industries that are hard to crack – telecoms and digital advertising.

The company was Runner-up for Deloitte’s Rising Star award in 2016, won the Disruptor of the Year award of Mumbrella Asia in 2017 and this year Reinartz was also on the list of Digerati APAC list of The Drum.

“Even though Postr is expanding globally, New Zealand offers a great environment for start-ups and we intend to keep our holding structure, headquarters and our core team in research and development based here. The government support around R&D tax credits as well as R&D grants totaling NZ$357,000 from Callaghan Innovation has been very helpful for us,” said Reinartz.

With offices now in Wellington, Auckland, Singapore and Vietnam and representative offices in Indonesia, Portugal and Germany, the company’s footprint is going global but its outlook is focused.

Reinartz says the secret to Postr’s rapid recent success has been a steep learning curve and a focus on creating operational excellence across remote teams.

“Getting an enterprise deal done is one thing; turning it into a massive success is another. We are starting to figure out a playbook that really works – how to structure the organization across markets and business units and how to best work with local partners in dispersed and culturally differentiated markets. We have also simplified and streamlined our tech to make use of the economies of scale across multiple fast growing apps.”

And this success is reflected in the numbers. Postr has seen over 2 million installs worldwide, allowing it to serve close to 500 million ads this year. Also, perhaps even more exciting, the company has already given more than 500 Terabytes of mobile connectivity to consumers this year.

Postr has launched with three international telecoms over the past year – the biggest players in their markets; Telkomsel in Indonesia is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world with 160 million subscribers; Telefonica (O2) in Germany and Altice in Portugal.

The company is launching more apps with leading mobile network operators in Singapore, Chile, South Africa, Algeria and Jordan. To boost its growth, Postr will also launch similar B2C apps in developed markets including the United States and Canada in the near future.

Back in New Zealand, the Postr bench is strong with ten staff in Wellington and two in Auckland. Reinartz says the local market remains a priority and he has hopes for new growth at home with its original telco app SkinnyCollect, following the significant recent marketing campaign of Skinny Mobile.

“While the scale is offshore, we have continued conversations with the Kiwi telecom operators to launch new innovative products. Early talks with one New Zealand carrier about big data monetisation have been particularly exciting,” said Reinartz.

“The New Zealand market was a great test run for our global expansion – it’s the perfect spot to see how a developed market reacts to a product and this has allowed us to scale across the world. We would love to repeat this process with new products we will be launching over the coming year.”

Investment has been another key to the company’s international trajectory, with NZ$5.7million raised from NZ investors including NZVIF (The New Zealand Venture Investment Fund), K1W1 (Sir Stephen Tindall’s family office VC), super-Angel James Sweetbaum, Angel HQ and ICE Angels, and international players including Koh Boon Hwee, a well-known Singaporean Angel investor who is also a board member of GIC (Singapore’s US$359 billion Sovereign Wealth Fund), MDI Ventures (corporate venture capital arm of Southeast Asian telecom giant Telkom Indonesia), Gunung Sewu Group (prominent Indonesia-based family office) and others.

And with significant growth opportunities ahead, Reinartz says Postr will continually be looking for strategic partners and investors to help achieve its full potential for global domain leadership.

“It’s always been important for us to find the right investors and to build a board that has an understanding of the telecommunications and advertising industries – people who are in a position to provide the right governance to help our exec team achieve our goals in 2018 and beyond.”

Alongside the line-up of high profile investors, Postr has an enviable line-up of Board members, such as chairman David Akers, who was a director of GreenButton up until their successful exit and purchase by Microsoft in 2014. Other board members include Singaporean based Chon-Phung Lim, who held VP and SVP titles at Hewlett-Packard and Oracle Corporation respectively, and Mun-Kein Chang, current VP Product Management at global roaming business Syniverse.

There’s plenty luring Chinese tech giants to Indonesia as they look to expand geographically. The country not only has attractive demographics, but also better prospects for building up market share than in India — the other obvious frontier — because Indonesians were shopping online through social media before the launch of official e-commerce sites. About three quarters of Indonesians aged 14 and above, some 140 million people, use Facebook regularly, compared with only a quarter in India, at 241 million.

About half of online shopping transactions flowed through social media sites in 2014, but with better logistics support — such as shipping and payments — e-commerce operators can easily lure small merchants away. By 2020, social media will account for only 12 percent of the total gross merchandise volume, CLSA estimates.

Even by dollar volume, sales in Indonesia, with the help of Chinese investment, could outpace India’s in two years, CLSA estimates.Indonesia generated almost $13 billion worth of e-commerce transactions in 2017, compared with $17.8 billion in India.

That’s where the good news ends.

To break even, e-commerce needs to be able to generate at least $4.50 in revenue from every $100 transaction conducted on their sites, according to CLSA analyst Paul McKenzie. Online retailers can charge for advertising or commission fees.

That’s a tall order. Best-in-class Alibaba, which controls 58 percent of China’s online shopping market, can only get a 2.5 percent take-rate from its advertising services. What kind of pricing power does the more-fragmented Indonesian e-commerce industry have?

As for other fees: There aren’t any. In their battle for small merchants, platforms such as Lazada Indonesia only charge sellers a one-time fee for joining. With such steep competition, requiring even a nominal payment could send customers elsewhere.

Shopee is the only player that offers us some glimpse into the operators’ financials, through the filings of its parent, Sea. Despite a 170 percent jump in gross merchandise volume in the second quarter, the company’s operating loss isn’t narrowing fast enough. Sales and marketing expenses, which include subsidies to merchants and consumers, remain elevated.

The only viable way for the Chinese to make money in this market is perhaps through industry consolidation. After all, Indonesia has already seen some high-profile mergers, such as Grab’s takeover of Uber Technologies Inc.’s entire Southeast Asian business this year. Could Jack Ma engineer a marriage between Tokopedia and Lazada Indonesia?

As Chinese money pours into Indonesia, the venture-capital culture there is also changing. To mainland tech tycoons, profitability is often beside the point. Just look at some of China’s hottest tech IPOs this year: Cash burn is the path to success.

“It pains me to think that our FDWs, many of whom are someone’s daughter, sister and possibly even mother, are being marketed in such a manner. It is a given that we should treat them with respect,” she said.

The MOM was first alerted to the Carousell listings on Sept 14 and put up a Facebook post to warn other employment agencies against such practices.

The ministry also told Carousell to take down the offending posts.

Said the MOM in its statement: ""MOM expects all employment agencies to exercise a duty of care towards their clients, including FDWs.

""The ministry sternly warns employment agencies against similar actions that would denigrate the dignity of FDWs working in Singapore.""

The ministry said it was in touch with the Indonesian Embassy, which has been informed of the matter and that the MOM was investigating the case.

The listings on Carousell were posted by user @maid.recruitment and showed the faces of several maids, allegedly from Indonesia.

Some of the posts indicated that the maids had been ""sold"".

The postings had prompted the Indonesian Embassy to say that it would request a thorough investigation of the advertisements.

According to The Jakarta Post, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's overseas citizen protection director, Mr Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, had said on Sunday that the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore had voiced concerns about the practice to the MOM.

He was quoted as saying that the embassy would send a diplomatic note to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express concern that similar incidents had occurred several times and to request a thorough investigation of such cases."

New Zealands ad tech start-up Postr announces significant international growth with major telecom partners including Telkomsel, Telefonica and AlticeNew Zealand’s ad tech start-up Postr announces significant international growth with major telecom partners including Telkomsel, Telefonica and Altice

Wellington’s four year old ad-tech start-up Postr has experienced rapid global growth through partnerships with three top international telecoms, a doubling of its staff to 25 and a quadrupling of monthly revenue over the past 6 months.

Postr’s white label apps, which allow content generators and advertisers to connect with consumers on their smartphone lock screens and lets telecoms unlock free data for their customers, is proving a winner as the company approaches a NZ$2million annual recurring revenue run-rate this quarter.

Its Founder and CEO, former advertising creative Milan Reinartz, who recently made the Forbes 30 under 30 Asia list, is proud of his company’s significant global growth over a short period of time, bridging two industries that are hard to crack – telecoms and digital advertising.

The company was Runner-up for Deloitte’s Rising Star award in 2016, won the Disruptor of the Year award of Mumbrella Asia in 2017 and this year Reinartz was also on the list of Digerati APAC list of The Drum.

“Even though Postr is expanding globally, New Zealand offers a great environment for start-ups and we intend to keep our holding structure, headquarters and our core team in research and development based here. The government support around R&D tax credits as well as R&D grants totaling NZ$357,000 from Callaghan Innovation has been very helpful for us,” said Reinartz.

With offices now in Wellington, Auckland, Singapore and Vietnam and representative offices in Indonesia, Portugal and Germany, the company’s footprint is going global but its outlook is focused.

Reinartz says the secret to Postr’s rapid recent success has been a steep learning curve and a focus on creating operational excellence across remote teams.

“Getting an enterprise deal done is one thing; turning it into a massive success is another. We are starting to figure out a playbook that really works – how to structure the organization across markets and business units and how to best work with local partners in dispersed and culturally differentiated markets. We have also simplified and streamlined our tech to make use of the economies of scale across multiple fast growing apps.”

And this success is reflected in the numbers. Postr has seen over 2 million installs worldwide, allowing it to serve close to 500 million ads this year. Also, perhaps even more exciting, the company has already given more than 500 Terabytes of mobile connectivity to consumers this year.

Postr has launched with three international telecoms over the past year – the biggest players in their markets; Telkomsel in Indonesia is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world with 160 million subscribers; Telefonica (O2) in Germany and Altice in Portugal.

The company is launching more apps with leading mobile network operators in Singapore, Chile, South Africa, Algeria and Jordan. To boost its growth, Postr will also launch similar B2C apps in developed markets including the United States and Canada in the near future.

Back in New Zealand, the Postr bench is strong with ten staff in Wellington and two in Auckland. Reinartz says the local market remains a priority and he has hopes for new growth at home with its original telco app SkinnyCollect, following the significant recent marketing campaign of Skinny Mobile.

“While the scale is offshore, we have continued conversations with the Kiwi telecom operators to launch new innovative products. Early talks with one New Zealand carrier about big data monetisation have been particularly exciting,” said Reinartz.

“The New Zealand market was a great test run for our global expansion – it’s the perfect spot to see how a developed market reacts to a product and this has allowed us to scale across the world. We would love to repeat this process with new products we will be launching over the coming year.”

Investment has been another key to the company’s international trajectory, with NZ$5.7million raised from NZ investors including NZVIF (The New Zealand Venture Investment Fund), K1W1 (Sir Stephen Tindall’s family office VC), super-Angel James Sweetbaum, Angel HQ and ICE Angels, and international players including Koh Boon Hwee, a well-known Singaporean Angel investor who is also a board member of GIC (Singapore’s US$359 billion Sovereign Wealth Fund), MDI Ventures (corporate venture capital arm of Southeast Asian telecom giant Telkom Indonesia), Gunung Sewu Group (prominent Indonesia-based family office) and others.

And with significant growth opportunities ahead, Reinartz says Postr will continually be looking for strategic partners and investors to help achieve its full potential for global domain leadership.

“It’s always been important for us to find the right investors and to build a board that has an understanding of the telecommunications and advertising industries – people who are in a position to provide the right governance to help our exec team achieve our goals in 2018 and beyond.”

Alongside the line-up of high profile investors, Postr has an enviable line-up of Board members, such as chairman David Akers, who was a director of GreenButton up until their successful exit and purchase by Microsoft in 2014. Other board members include Singaporean based Chon-Phung Lim, who held VP and SVP titles at Hewlett-Packard and Oracle Corporation respectively, and Mun-Kein Chang, current VP Product Management at global roaming business Syniverse.

How about JBS?

Here’s a hint: one of them is named after man named Jose Batista Sobrinho.

Another hint: Sobrinho was a prosperous Brazilian cattleman.

If you guessed the companies have something to do with beef, congratulations.

In fact, they’re two of the world’s largest meatpackers, and ithey supply everyone from Walmart and McDonald’s in the United States to Marks & Spencer in the United Kingdom, and thousands of companies in between.

Both, however, grew at the expense of the Amazon forest, which farmers have been chopping for a century to feed our ravenous appetites for soy and beef. Then, a decade ago, Brazil’s major meatpackers signed the “Cattle Agreements”, which are two voluntary commitments to stop buying from any ranches that chop forest, use slave labor, or graze on indigenous territories or protected lands.

The Cattle Agreements came three years after grain companies like Cargill and Louis Dreyfus agreed to a similar moratorium on soy products from the Amazon, and something similar is happening in Indonesia as well. There, perpetual environmental bad boys like Wilmar and Asia Pulp & Paper have started changing the way they buy their pulp, paper, and palm – often by joining multilateral trade organizations that promote sustainable land-use.

These are just a handful of the roughly 500 companies that have pledged to reduce their impact on forests, according to the Forest Trends Supply Change initiative. All of these pledges and programs have two things in common: first, they involve the big four commodities that drive most of the world’s deforestation – namely, cattle and soy in Brazil and palm and pulp & paper in Indonesia – and second, they’re largely led by the private sector, usually in response to NGO pressure.

But what about governments? After all, these two countries account for about 40 percent of the world’s tropical deforestation, and we can’t expect the companies that created the mess to fix it on their own.

Both governments, it turns out, have created national climate action plans – technically called “NDCs”, for “Nationally-Determined Contributions” – and both of those plans involve saving forests, which is critical because deforestation generates between 15 and 20 percent of the greenhouse gases that man is responsible for emitting.

Unfortunately, the private and public initiatives mostly work parallel to each other rather than togethber, according to a new report called “Collaboration Toward Zero Deforestation: Aligning Corporate and National Commitments in Brazil and Indonesia”, which looks at the ways government and the private sector are – and are not – cooperating to reduce greenhouse gasses created by the way these two countries manage their forests, farms, and fields.

Published jointly by Forest Trends and the Environmental Defense Fund, the report identifies more than a dozen initiatives – some led by NGOs, some led by green-minded companies, and others led by governmental agencies – and it suggests ways of linking them to turbocharge their results.

More on the Podcast For a deep dive into the report findings, you can access it directly here, or listen to Episode 20 of the Bionic Planet Podcast, which features an in-depth interview with authors Brian Schaap of Forest Trends and Breanna Lujan of the Environmental Defense Fund. Bionic Planet is available at Bionic-Planet.com, as well as on iTunes, TuneIn, Stitcher, and wherever you access podcasts. You can also listen here:

Why Indonesia and Brazil?

You’ll never confuse Brazil and Indonesia on a map: one is a solid landmass covering half a continent, while the other is a “Land of a Thousand Islands” (or, technically, about 15 thousand islands) – scattered across the sea. Brazil has four times more land than Indonesia does, but each country spreads out over about 3 million square miles of territory, and Indonesia’s peat soils emit both methane and carbon when poorly managed. That means they’re both massive emitters of greenhouse gases from deforestation.

They also face surprisingly similar challenges: both have poorly-demarcated land ownership, which makes environmental laws difficult to enforce, and both have powerful and often corrupt agriculture sectors, which have tended to oppose liberal land reforms.

Similar solutions have also emerged in both countries, and that’s where the report focuses.

“We don’t want to sugarcoat anything, but by nature we did want to look at what’s working rather than at the bad stuff, which is already widely-reported,” said Brian Schaap of Forest Trends in a recent episode of the Bionic Planet podcast.

Schaap wrote the section focused on Indonesia, while Breanna Lujan and Dana Miller of Environmental Defense Fund wrote the section focused on Brazil.

Breaking it Down

The authors break each country’s NDC into individual objectives, then they explore the ways existing initiatives either do or don’t help to achieve that objective, and finally they offer suggestions for scaling up what works.

Brazil’s NDC, for example, has five components relevant to land use, and one of them is “sustainable agricultural development”. Lujan and Miller explore several initiatives that support this objective, beginning with the state of Mato Grosso’s existing efforts to restore degraded pasture. They then show how this dovetails with the Cattle Agreements, which have prompted farmers to adopt more efficient grazing strategies. Then they drill deeper into two specific programs – namely, the Novo Campo Program, which the Instituto Centro de Vida launched together with JBS and several rural unions, research organizations, and NGOs; and the São Félix do Xingu project in the state of Pará, which The Nature Conservancy launched together with regional authorities, Brazilian NGOs, and Marfrig, Walmart, and Cargill.

The Novo Campo Program has spread to 40 ranches across the state of Mato Grosso, while the São Félix do Xingu project has dramatically slashed deforestation in Pará – thanks, it must be said, in part to federal incentives developed under the presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Both programs, Lujan and Miller conclude, can be replicated “to help companies to go beyond the Cattle Agreements to achieve deforestation across their supply chains while increasing agricultural production.”

Schaap does something similar with Indonesia: breaking the country’s NDC into five components, and then exploring their interrelationship with eight initiatives – three governmental, three corporate, and three conducted across jurisdictions involving multiple stakeholders.

The Power of Cooperation

The authors identified several multilateral stakeholder groups, such as the Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests, and Agriculture, that can serve as conduits between government, the private sector, and NGOs.

“The Coalition is the epitome of a multi-stakeholder platform,” said Lujan. “It has 131 members, including NGOs and companies such as Cargill and Carrefour, and it was initially created to provide a platform for these bodies to come together and talk about their expectations for the NDC, but it became a really great space for members to come together and exchange ideas.”

Schaap agrees, and identifies the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as a group that has helped forge cooperation across Indonesia, echoing findings from the Forest Trends Supply Change initiative, which which actively tracks progress on pledges made by roughly 500 companies. Earlier this year, Supply Change found that join such groups are not only more likely to make commitments, but they’re also more likely to disclose progress towards achieving them – even if that progress is disappointing.

The findings, obviously, don’t end there. After all, this is a 45-page report that draws on more than 100 sources and examines more than a dozen programs in detail. It provides as solid a snapshot of current initiatives, and Schaap says it just scratches the surface

“Both realms of action – government action and corporate responsibility to reduce deforestation – are huge in their own right,” he says. “We’re beginning to explore those connections in two key countries, but there’s really a lot more work to be done on this topic, and I hope to see other organizations writing reports, and we hope to go deeper and continue asking these sorts of questions.”"

Singapore

THE recent free-fall of the rupiah could have led to jitters among investors and Singapore companies exposed to Indonesia, but analysts say the country remains attractive for businesses - in particular, startups - to venture into on the back of strong fundamentals.

More Singapore startups are also actively looking at opportunities in Indonesia, with about 30 of them currently seeking help from Enterprise Singapore to enter the market - a number that the government agency said has been ramped up in the last 18 months.

""Coming into Indonesia is both risk and opportunity. It is a large market with demographics in its favour, but the risk is mainly on the financial depth of the market - currency is just one of them,"" said UOB's Indonesia economist Enrico Tanuwidjaja.

sentifi.com Market voices on:

Despite the risks involved, he noted a ""sustained momentum"" in interest from global investors and startups to enter the Indonesia market in the past few years through joint ventures with domestic partners.

This is because key ingredients to spur innovation in Indonesia have remained intact, with a market seen to be large enough to allow more players in the innovation space, said Khairul Anwar, regional group director (Jakarta), Enterprise Singapore.

These include a young and growing population of 260 million with half below of them below 25 years old, growing demand to get products and services across the sprawling archipelago, as well as cash-flushed firms looking to deploy their capital into startups.

With four unicorns - Go-Jek, Tokopedia, Traveloka and Bukalapak - in its bag, Indonesia today boasts a ""lively"" startup scene that has rekindled a spirit of entrepreneurship and drawn interest from both major domestic and international players, said Mr Anwar. A unicorn is a startup with a valuation of US$1 billion.

Investments have skyrocketed from US$50 million five years ago to US$3 billion in the first half of 2017.

For Singapore startups to seize opportunities in Indonesia, Mr Anwar identified five in-demand areas: e-commerce services, logistics and fulfilment, fintech, e-health services, and deep tech.

With the rise of e-commerce brings the need for related services that attract more SMEs and consumers to buy and sell online, such as fraud detection, e-commerce on-boarding and digital marketing.

But the e-commerce market remains ""highly fragmented and under- developed"", he said. The lack of locally-developed solutions presents an opportunity for Singapore solutions to be integrated with existing Indonesian service providers and platforms.

The growth of e-commerce has also created new issues in terms of logistics and fulfilment due to Indonesia's geography and low infrastructure provision.

""Last-mile fulfilment is a crowded field with low profitability. It is better to work with existing distribution networks and provide the platform, algorithms, services and financing, rather than to own the trucks directly,"" advised Mr Anwar.

""We should work on our strengths in cross-border logistics and Singapore's strength as a sourcing, distribution and logistics hub to serve Indonesia cost effectively.""

Fintech in the form of e-payments is another area that local startups can look at as people need to pay for e-commerce and there is still no clear winner in the market, he added, urging Singapore businesses to explore being a gateway or integrator instead of creating a new form of e-payment, due to the difficulty of obtaining required licenses for foreign entities.

But despite the abundance of opportunity, Indonesia remains a tough nut to crack, noted analysts.

As an emerging market, the country comes with risks as seen in the latest currency crisis, where the rupiah fell to its lowest level since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998.

UOB's Mr Tanuwidjaja said that the currency challenge can be mitigated through financial products such as hedging and options to take into account future movements.

Joongshik Wang, EY Asean Digital Strategy - M&A Leader, also noted that a depreciating rupiah might not always work against startups looking to invest in Indonesia.

""With the falling rupiah, market entry cost will be lower for startups to consider an aggressive approach to entering the market,"" he said.

""But they should be mindful that exiting may become more expensive, as valuation is dependent on the assets' stability and visibility in the country.""

Singapore startups currently in Indonesia say they are keeping a close watch on the situation, but most are not overly concerned as risks are part and parcel of venturing into emerging markets.

Darius Cheung, CEO of 99.Co, said some steps that the business has taken to manage the currency crisis was to keep cash mainly in Singdollar or US dollar, and to change only when needed. He suggested that startups lock as much of their expense contracts in rupiah, while locking in as much revenue in either US dollar or Singdollar as possible.

Indonesia accounts for half of 99.co's business, and it is growing 20-25 per cent each quarter.

Mr Cheung said the political uncertainty surrounding the Indonesian elections due next year is also something to look at. ""It is hard to predict what can happen. We generally have to be 'switched on' and strategise around it,"" he said. ""For example, we are currently focused more on the 'own-stay' segment of properties because many investors are holding off buying luxury property until elections are over.""

Carlson Lau, CEO and co-founder of co-working space operator Cocowork (formerly EV Hive), acknowledged that macroeconomic risks ""exist in any country"" and are often beyond the control of businessmen.

Cocowork is Indonesia's largest co-working space operator, with 21 co-working spaces and 30,000 square metres of space.

Mr Lau's advice for startups looking to successfully venture into Indonesia regardless of headwinds is to forge strong local partnerships to scale and customise products to fit the market.

""What can be controlled is having a great product, a strong distribution network, good local partners and a committed team driving the business - and any business could ride out economic cycles,"" he said.

Enterprise Singapore's Mr Anwar emphasised that if startups ""tread wisely"", the upside of investing in Indonesia can be very high. With more unicorns expected to spring from Indonesia in the next few years, local startups need to catch this wave.

""Singapore companies cannot be absent from this market if they are serious about the startup and tech sector, and be serious about growing big,"" he added."

HELICAP, a Singapore-based platform that offers funding to alternative lenders such as peer-to-peer platforms, has found new backers in form of Soilbuild Group, having raised US$5 million pre-series A funding from the property firm and early-stage venture fund East Ventures, BT understands.

The platform, which has been deploying funds since the second quarter of this year, claims no loan defaults at the moment.

David Wang, CEO and co-founder of Helicap, said that Helicap - short for Helicopter Capital - has diverted capital to platforms with the lowest default rates, without divulging the names of such platforms.

sentifi.com Market voices on:

It works with 300 partners that include peer-to-peer lenders and microfinanciers. These partners, in turn, offer financing to corporate and consumers. On average, the loan tenures have a short duration of between six and 18 months.

""Currently, our partners include the top platforms in Indonesia, Singapore and Cambodia. We are looking to expand to the Philippines and Vietnam next,"" noted Mr Wang.

In a media statement sent to BT, Lim Han Feng, director of Soilbuild Group, said the firm has been ""hugely impressed"" with Helicap attracting established investors, partners and advisers in such a short time.

Mr Wang added that Soilbuild can work with Helicap in diversifying the lending platform's portfolio, given Soilbuild's experience in the property space.

Asked about the startup's due diligence process, Mr Wang would only say that the firm has built proprietary tools and processes that assess both equity and credit risks of originators and their potential to scale with Helicap's capital.

""A thorough analysis of their loan book is necessary prior to any investment decision. We use a data-driven approach to assess the health and quality of a loan book at the early stages of our due diligence process.""

Helicap did not disclose how much capital it has deployed thus far, but Mr Wang told BT that the platform aims to push out US$20 million in the next six months.

Helicap also plans to expand further into Indonesia, and hire staff to boost its technology and data teams.

Willson Cuaca, managing partner of East Ventures, said through a media statement that Helicap will play a ""significant"" role in its portfolio, in validating and consolidating the region's emerging alternative lending market.

The latest funding round by Helicap follows in quick succession from the US$1.5 million seed round in May led by Singapore's former Minister of State for Manpower, Teo Ser Luck.

Mr Teo is currently chairman of fintech firm Nufin Data. which is reportedly working with Helicap to look at reducing invoice fraud and credit risk through data analytics.

Helicap has also listed Lim How Teck, former group deputy CEO of NOL Group, as its chairman. Mr Lim is chairman of Temasek's Heliconia Capital Management."

Instapay complements Indonesia’s “Ayo UMKM Jualan Online” (Let SMEs Sell Online) campaign to get SMEs across Indonesia to trade products online

Targets to have 8 million SMEs customers to leverage on MC Payment platform by 2020

Mobile micro financing and instalments platform for SMEs will be rolled out in the coming months



SINGAPORE/ HONG KONG, CHINA – Media OutReach – 13 September 2018 – MC Payment, a homegrown fintech player, announced the soft launch of Instapay, a B2C payment platform targeting Indonesian Small-Medium Enterprises (“SMEs”) market. Instapay enables merchants and their customers to simplify payment transactions, by using social messaging apps such as Whatsapp and Line to facilitate payments. Approximately 1000 merchants have signed up and utilized the payment services to date.



Instapay is a mobile application that provides businesses with the ability to invoice their customers via social media and accept various payment methods. It can be performed quickly, easily, securely, anytime and anywhere. Instapay can help small business owners expand into international markets and accept international credit cards. It can also accept credit card payments without website integration or EDC machine.



PT MCP Indo Utama (MC Payment’s Indonesia division) Country Director, Mr Valerino Wijaya said “MC Payment has identified pain points associated with payment processes in SMEs. This includes inability to monitor and accept a wide range of payment channels. Instapay provides an easy mobile-based solution that directly solves these problems so businesses can focus on what they do best.”



Many industries look to benefit from the convenience offered by Instapay. The wedding industry for instance has many sole-proprietor businesses such as florists and tailors who will benefit. Similarly, small retailers selling shoes and fashion accessories online as well as small-to-medium hotels and villas in the tourism industry will benefit from the enlarged consumer market size.



This is in tandem with Indonesia’s “Ayo UMKM Jualan Online” (Let SMEs Sell Online) campaign1, which is aimed at attracting and persuading SMEs across Indonesia to sell products via online marketplaces to increase profits and prosperity. Several government bodies that have taken part in the campaign include the Communications and Information Ministry, the Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry and the Creative Economy Agency (Bekraf). 6 online marketplaces who were involved are; Blibli.com, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Shopee, Lazada and Blanja.com.



The Indonesian government has set the goal of letting 8 million SMEs go online by 2020. As of 2017, there are a total of 59.26 million SMEs operated in Indonesia. However only 3.97 million SMEs were active online.



MC Payment’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Anthony Koh, said, “MC Payment is pleased to strengthen our market presence in Indonesia with Instapay. Approximately 1000 Indonesia merchants signing with us, is a testimony of the platform accessibility and stability. Instapay enables small merchants to save time without the hassle of going to a bank. At the same time, these small business owners will be able to manage their cashflows better.”



“MC Payment will be rolling out supporting services like mobile micro financing and instalments for SMEs in the coming months. SMEs can get small loans approved within 24-hours using their mobile phones. We will keep the public updated in due course.”

MIL OSI Economics –"
82;786638486;20180913;2018;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/how-ritesh-agarwals-oyo-scaled-the-great-wall-of-china/articleshow/65791420.cms;BENGALURU: When hotel chain OYO decided to expand to China in December, the go-to market strategy was clear in chief executive Ritesh Agarwal’s mind. He didn’t want to think like an Indian company launching operations in another country. Instead, “we wanted to think like a company in China that was trying to emulate OYO.” This, Agarwal believes, helped OYO take a more local approach and avoid some of the mistakes a foreign company would commit.“Most companies… usually go to China as if they are launching a foreign company in China,” Agarwal told ET. “From our perspective, the only (hotel) company that can do a good job (in China) would be one that emulates OYO.”So for every decision that the OYO team has to make in China, they ask, “What would the company that was copying OYO do?”, and plan accordingly.“Most foreign companies look at recruiting bilingual management teams in a different country. We didn’t make that a criteria because a local company wouldn’t have that constraint and if we would have that constraint, we would narrow our talent pool,” said Agarwal.Now, almost 10 months since it launched in China, OYO operates over 50,000 rooms across 50 cities in the country. Agarwal said the hotels that have come under the OYO brand in China have seen occupancy rates grow from 20-25% to 60-65% in a couple of months.“We believe that if we continue doing this, we will be able to generate a significant amount of OYO’s global revenue from China,” Agarwal said.OYO has operations also in Malaysia and Nepal and plans to expand to Indonesia and the UK.China has its Airbnb equivalents such as Tujia, which targets a similar customer bracket looking at alternatives to expensive hotels. Industry experts estimate the budget hotel market opportunity in China to be 5-10 times bigger than that of India’s in terms of the number of hotels and travellers.In India, where OYO says it is close to reaching profitability, the company has an estimated 100,000 exclusive rooms under its management, with a presence in 230 cities. Between January and June, OYO hotels in India clocked 17 million booked rooms nights.When it comes to cultural differences between India and China, Agarwal says there aren’t many. “In OYO India, when employees sign off on their targets, we have the OYO tree where employees come and tie a red thread and the target… and a year later, they come and pull it out,” said Agarwal. “When we showed this tradition to our Chinese team, they said this is what happens in China as well.”That said, certain differences exist in terms of customer expectations.Agarwal said that while customers in India expect full-blown service even at economy hotels, Chinese customers’ expectations tilt more towards having better infrastructure at economy hotels. OYO was able to gather these insights by going into the country with zero preconceived notions and starting with a clean slate, he said.Agarwal was talking on the sidelines of Extreme Entrepreneurs 2018, a training series for startups organised by Lightspeed India Partners, an investor in OYO.Other investors include Japan’s SoftBank, which is the largest shareholder in OYO, holding around 45% stake. Sequoia Capital India holds 11% stake and Agarwal, 11-12%.

Existing investors Mandiri Capital, Convergence, and Fenox also participated in the round, according to an official statement.

The value of the round is over ten times its previous funding round which was closed only last year at $2 million, led by Mandiri Capital Indonesia.

Founded in 2014 by Haryanto Tanjo and Grady Laksmono, Moka provides an end-to-end POS and payment solution that caters to small and medium businesses in Indonesia. The service includes an Android/iOS app used by store cashiers and a web back-office that allows store owners to access data such as sales reports, inventory, and customer feedback in real-time.

Over the last 12 months, the company has also found traction among larger retail and F&B chains. It now serves 12,000 businesses in the food & beverage, retail, and beauty categories, and is close to hitting $1 billion in annual transaction volume.

The new capital, Moka says, will give the company fresh ammunition to speed up product development as it expands its services beyond SMEs to enterprise clients.

“Sequoia India was inspired by Moka’s vision to create a multi-faceted software platform for business operations and payments, and are very excited to work with a stellar founding team to help achieve that vision,” said Shailendra Singh, Managing Director at Sequoia Capital (India) Singapore.

Over the past months, Moka has started engaging in partnerships with other fintech companies to launch both payments and business loans products on the Moka platform, integrating e-payment services with OVO, T-Cash and Akulaku, and has signed partnerships with other e-wallets such as DANA and Kredivo.

It has also Moka has also launched Moka Capital to extend business loans to its merchants through the app, by teaming up with Koinworks, Taralite, and Modalku as its P2P lending partners.

“Beyond a leader in mobile POS, Moka has a great potential to become an offline-to-online gateway for various mobile payments, app and software solution. We believe that the investment will help Moka strengthen its leadership in mobile POS and accelerate its expansion to adjacent businesses.” said Sean Lee, Managing Director at SoftBank Ventures Korea.

In the Indonesian Mpos space, Moka competes with Cashlez, Pawoon and Olsera. Last month this portal reported that Cashlez, which is also backed by Mandiri Capital, is in talks to raise around $5 million for a new funding round.

The initiative will be globally presented in Indonesia, Malaysia, India, South Africa between July and September, with 80 selected start-ups

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, 11 September 2018 – Samsung has arranged the Global Start-up Acceleration Programme in South Africa, in partnership with the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) and NGO Nangila to mentor start-ups in various fields to support the sustainable growth of entrepreneurs.

Thirty-four employees from Samsung’s global headquarters in South Korea, will be mentoring 19 start-ups in Cape Town for four days as part of the Samsung Employee Volunteer Programme. These volunteers are using their own time to assist these businesses in becoming digitised and helping them to find the right Information and Communications solutions for their needs. This is a part of Samsung South Africa’s ongoing mission to address the critical technical and engineering skills shortage and demonstrate its commitment to the Enterprise and Supplier Development agenda. The initiative is also aligned with government’s Vision 2030, that encourages entrepreneurship and self-employment initiatives.

From 10 to 13 September 2018, small businesses will participate in a boot-camp to better understand the hurdles they face in developing their products and services. They will then showcase their business models to Venture Capital firms and a panel consisting of staff from Samsung South Africa, Samsung South Korea and SEDA. On the last day, Deputy Minister of Small Business Development, Cassel Mathale, will officiate at the prize giving ceremony.

“At Samsung we strive to encourage young minds and nurture the spirit of innovation. With the Global Start-up Acceleration Programme, our experts and engineers from various domains are volunteering to support the sustainable growth of local entrepreneurs in their early stages,” said Hlubi Shivanda, Director: Business Innovation Group and Corporate Affairs.

Since 2010, about 1,500 employees have joined this programme in 43 countries. This year, Samsung is focused on supporting local entrepreneurs and helping them build their businesses for a sustainable impact on society.

This programme is also being presented in Indonesia, Malaysia and India. Among the winners in the four countries, five small businesses will be invited to visit Samsung’s headquarters in South Korea.

The selected participants work in a wide array of areas, such as security for cloud data, Artificial Intelligence-powered solutions, Information Management Systems, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Health-Care Solutions, the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare and energy efficient IoT devices.

Samsung employee volunteers bring their global business experience and expertise in the domains of B2B market research, pricing strategies, IoT strategic planning, Artificial Intelligence, cloud, data, strategic investments and planning, databases, machine leaning algorithms, Android programming, health-care businesses, computer vision technology and biomedical engineering to the table, amongst other skills.

“The kind of support a start-up receives in its initial phase can define its success. As a company that strongly believes in co-prosperity as one of our core values, we are proud to partner with SEDA and NGO Nangila to provide infrastructure and mentorship to fledgling businesses. We believe this can be the catalyst that helps the entrepreneurship ecosystem grow,” said Shivanda."

The lack of institutional support is one of major factors behind the failure of many startups to take off and thrive, experts say.

“80-90 percent of startups fail in the early stages because they don’t have enough funding to move on to the expansion stage,” said Phan Hoang Lan, head of the Financial Planning Division under the Ministry of Science and Technology's Market Development Department.

Funding for startups mostly comes from venture capital funds, businesses and angel investors, not from the government, experts said at a recent conference.

There are three periods in the development of a startup - discovery, validation and expansion, said Lan.

It is in the first two periods that startups need funding the most, Lan said, adding that they end up raising money from family and friends or spending their own.

This situation is very different from other countries like Singapore, where the government offers a variety of grants that can support up to 70 percent of a company’s costs, according to Tech in Asia.

The U.S. News and World ranks Singapore as the 8th best country for starting a business in its 2018 Best Countries Rankings.

Vietnam was ranked 52nd, behind other countries in Asia like Japan (2nd), South Korea (12th), Malaysia (34th), Thailand (38th) and the Philippines (45th).

Since 2015, the government has only been investing in startups in the middle stage of their development, not in the earlier ones, said Lan, who is also the head researcher of the Vietnam-Finland Innovation Partnership Program (IPP2), which seeks to improve local support mechanisms for new innovative companies.

“Government funding for startups should start in the early period. The government needs to be willing to accept failures in their investments, which could also bring a lot of benefits,” she said.

IPP2 research shows that early government funding will reduce the “crowding out effects,” which is when the government’s involvement in a sector substantially affects private companies by reducing their investment spending.

When a business has overcome the difficult period, it will no longer be dependent on the government’s capital and can source investment from other private companies.

Echoing Lan, Nguyen Tri Hieu, an economist with over 30 years of experience working in the U.S. and Vietnam, said startups in Vietnam mostly receive funding from family and friends in their earlier stages, not from the government.

In the U.S., startups can find financial support from the Small Business Administration (SBA), which has an annual budget approved by Congress to enable their establishment, Hieu told VnExpress International.

“But this is not the case in Vietnam, where they get very limited government budget support in some cities and provinces like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang and Can Tho,” he said.

Jouko Ahvenainen, CEO of digital finance firm Grow VC Group, affirmed the vital role of the government in supporting startups.

The government needs to build an ecosystem to help local and international investors connect with entrepreneurs and help them expand internationally, he said.

There should be good database of local startups so that investors can make their choices with greater ease, he added.

The number of startups in Vietnam has seen an increasing trend in recent years, reaching 92 last year, a 45 percent increase over 2016, according to the Topica Founder Institute (TFI), which has an annual program that trains and connects startups with potential investors.

These startups raised $291 million last year, up 42 percent from 2016, TFI said.

Startups in Southeast Asia attracted $7.86 billion in total last year, a threefold plus increase over 2016, Tech in Asia data shows.

Vietnam accounted for only 0.7 percent of that figure, lower than Thailand (2.2 percent), Malaysia (3.1) and Indonesia (22).

Without government support, some potential economic development will be weakened, said economist Hieu.

About 90 percent of Vietnamese businesses are of small and medium scale, but they create jobs for a majority of the labor force, he said.

“The future of the economy depends on the success of startups.”"

The summit, which will take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, on 11-13 September, holds the theme ‘ASEAN 4.0: Entrepreneurship and the Fourth Industrial Revolution’.

The three-day session has been designed “to offer students and the general public an opportunity to discuss what their future might look like as technological disruption shapes ASEAN 4.0.”

“The theme of the meeting […] reflects the significant transformations and disruptions that are now unfolding across South East Asia,” said Justin Wood, Head of Asia Pacific and Member of the Executive Committee at the WEF.

“One of the important responses to the challenges raised by disruptive technologies is entrepreneurship. It is through innovation that the region will grow the companies, shape the policies and build the economic systems of the future.”

Of the nearly 300 startups from across Southeast Asia which applied to join the meeting, 80 were selected by a panel of judges from startup accelerators, venture capital funds, technology experts and media personalities.

Among the shortlisted startups are BookMeBus, an online bus ticketing booking system in Cambodia, Thailand’s social enterprise Socialgiver, and Design for a Dream, an Indonesian platform which advocates and supports children with disabilities.

The 80 startups represent an ample variety of sectors, including, but not exclusively, healthcare, ecommerce, agriculture and financial services.

The products and services they are developing range from smart fertilisers that reduce nitrous-oxide emissions (a potent greenhouse gas) to sharia-compliant bitcoins to new healthcare options for elderly care.

“We expect the startups to make an important contribution to shaping the debates at the meeting about the impact and course of new technologies and disruptive business models. We believe that they will enrich important discussions about how to upgrade innovation ecosystems and promote entrepreneurship,” noted Wood.

“The startups will also benefit from their interactions with the other 1,000 participants at the summit, including 90 government ministers and 600 business leaders from more established companies.”

During the meeting, the startups will be fully involved in the official programme but will also have their own dedicated programme track to discuss critical issues facing entrepreneurs, from finding finance to achieving regional scale with limited resources.

There will also be a dedicated hub for the startups to share their stories of disruption and transformation.

The press release states that once the meeting is over, the WEF hopes to establish a permanent community for the startups to support their growth and development."

98;784856562;20180906;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/23780/indonesia/go-jek-p2p-lending-in-indonesia/;"Go-Jek, Indonesia’s unicorn darling just announced that they will be partnering with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending firms Findaya, Dana Cita and Aktivaku.to which marks them as yet another ride-hailing giant dabbling in financial services.

The company’s decision to join the lending scene is a strategic one for the Indonesian market, as the nation is fertile ground thanks to huge swaths of unbanked communities. The government has made huge strides towards financial inclusion in the nation, but this was a relatively recent development.

Back in 2011, only 20% of Indonesian adults had a bank account, which precluded them from being able to access financial services due to a lack of financial history with banks—even among those who had the means to pay the loans back. Meanwhile, Indonesians in poverty are unable to secure loans to carry them out of their situation and are stuck in a cycle of poverty.

This was the environment that cultivated the P2P businesses in Indonesia, and helped them flourish. Today, alternative lending amounts to US$27.5 million in 2018.

The lending platform Modalku proves the value in this scene as they record the largest funding round raised by a P2P lending platform in Southeast Asia, with US$ 25 Million raised led by Softbank Ventures.

The Indonesian Landscape

With a real need and a landscape rife with opportunities, we counted at least 40 players specifically dabbling in the P2P lending space. While there are a plethora of fraudulent players complicating the fray, the services are nevertheless seen in a positive light by the Indonesian people.

The popularity of P2P lending platforms lie in its efficiency—quite a few of these platforms are able to do credit screening more quickly than banks can, and offers lower interest as well. Another key appeal in P2P lending is the ability to receive even small loans. Companies like KoinWorks comes to mind, allowing loans at a minimum of 100,000 rupiahs.

There is often no need for collateral, and documents can be submitted ay time, instead of being subject to a bank’s office hours.

It is worth noting that analysts have warned that a more accurate credit assessment process should be developed if the industry is to progress, and it does seem likely that companies without this infrastructure will develop it as the scene matures.

The P2P lending scene is also attractive to lenders who are able to collect on interests incurred and grow their own wealth as the majority of lending platforms shoulder the risk.

Regulations

P2P lending services hit the nation by storm only 2 years ago, which marks the scene as a very nascent one. As such, the regulations on P2P lending are still relatively lax.

That being said, both the sheer volume and popularity of these platforms have driven OJK, the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia to establish a regulatory sandbox specifically for online lending services—which in a way, heralds the P2P lending industry in Indonesia as a cut beyond any other fintech.

After all, it is a win-win situation for the government. Many of those who borrow from these platforms use the seed money to run micro and SME businesses, which helps drive the economy.

OJK issued regulations that in part, requires P2P lending providers to apply for a permit. The regulator also stipulated that startups need to have at least $200,000 in capital to be approved for an operating license, and can only issue a maximum loan of $150,000.

Allowing for potential users to check for a licence could help cut through the scammy lending firms operating in Indonesia, and there are a lot of them. OJK has discovered at least 227 illegal online lending startups.

But this regulation should only be the beginning of OJK’s role into P2P lending, and does not provide a holistic solution to both cultivate and regulate the scene yet. Perhaps even the regulators themselves are purposefully being permissive to P2P lending startups to help them flourish.

What Will Happen When Indonesians Are Already Financially Included?

In Indonesia’s efforts to match up with the cashless trend gripping the word, the country’s financial inclusion grows rapidly—in fact, World Bank characterises Indonesia as the nation that makes the most progress in helping its unbanked populations among East Asia and the Pacific.

The 20% of banked adults in 2011 grew to 49% in 2017, and while the number is still lower than the global average, the nation is catching up fast.

For now, P2P lending businesses serve as a crucial stopgap that enables Indonesians to access lending while the government ramps up efforts to grow financial inclusion, but we can’t help wondering—once more adults develop a financial history through banking, will that spell the end for P2P lending?

We think that this will all depend on two important factors:

Do P2P lending firms offer more value beyond just borrowing money?

Can banks quickly innovate and upgrade their lending infrastructure to outpace fintech P2P lending firms?

Lending is still considered a fresh-faced sub-industry in the nation, which means that they are more agile and able to rapidly change their business model or strike strategic partnerships at the drop of a hat.

But things may not shake out into an either-or situation either.

Joining Forces with Banks

Fintech trends across the globe showcase previously agile and competitive fintech organisations eventually joining forces with the very banks they once attempted to disrupt. This usually happens when banks, attempting to innovate, realise that it is better to pull in already mature service instead of having to start their own inferior version from scratch. Meanwhile, fintech firms are enticed by a large pool of funds to dip into, and the opportunity to access corporate-level business opportunities.

Amartha, a P2P lending firm which started out as a group lending institution, already cooperates with the Central Bank of Indonesia (BNI) and could be one of the trendsetters paving the way for coalescence.

Or Indonesia Could Develop Its Own Lending Giant

Many situations that lead to convergence of banks and fintech happen in nations where banks hold a significant presence over the populace. So considering the relatively low banked populations, and a newly-formed clientele that lacks financial history, it’s possible that fintech services could outpace banks in the lending department.

China’s entire financial institution changed gears when e-wallets gained dominance in the nation, raising companies like Tencent and Alibaba into giants and in a perfect position to take advantage of the Belt and Silk Road Initative rolled out by the Chinese government.

In a similar vein, there is also the possibility of an Indonesian company rising up to become a fintech giant in Indonesia.

To this end, if we go by the precedent set by China, then Go-Jek is in a decent position to fill this role in Indonesia. Both Alibaba and WeChat started out in e-commerce and instant messaging respectively, before diversifying into wallets and striking gold.

Since lending is a different beast compared to e-cash though, this doesn’t preclude existing players like the highly-funded Modalku to rise to dominance regardless of their lack of diversification in services, simply due to experience and an existing clientele.

Rising population, incomes and urbanization will drive a 78 percent increase in meat and seafood demand from 2017 to 2050, according to a report by Asia Research and Engagement, a Singapore-based consultancy firm.

“We wanted to highlight that, because of the large population and how fast the population is growing, it is going to put a strain on the environment,” said Co-author Serena Tan. “By recognizing this and where it comes from, we can tackle the solutions.""

With supply chains ramping up to meet demand, greenhouse gas emissions will jump from 2.9 billion metric tons of CO2 per year to 5.4 billion metric tons, the equivalent of the lifetime emissions of 95 million cars, the researchers said.

A land area the size of India will be needed for additional food production, according to the report, while water use will climb from 577 billion cubic meters per year to 1,054 billion cubic meters per year.

The use of antimicrobials, which kill or stop the growth of microorganisms, and include antibiotics, will increase 44 percent to 39,000 metric tons per year, said the report, which was commissioned by the Hong Kong-based ADM Capital Foundation.

Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in food is rife in southeast Asia, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said this year, warning of serious risks for people and animals as bacterial infections become more resistant to treatment.

Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Pakistan are among nations likely to contribute most to the rise in meat and seafood consumption, while countries with aging populations, such as China, will likely limit growth, Tan said.

Food producers can increase efficiency by implementing rainwater harvesting, using sustainable animal feed and capturing biogas from cattle, she suggested.

Regulators, consumers and investors can also pressure restaurant chains and producers to limit the use of antibiotics in meat supplies, she added.

At meal times, consumers can also choose plant-based foods made to look like meats as an alternative, Tan said."

Indonesia is rife with opportunity for businesses, both foreign and domestic, to make money in this emerging economy. As the 14th largest country in the world and a population with a large portion under the age of 30, Indonesians are in a position to really impact economies in Southeast Asia. Whether establishing a business in Jakarta or another city, your business can perform well in any of the country’s primary industries.

In fact, the modern-day entrepreneur has little to worry about in looking to test markets in any country because online tools make accessing information regarding world markets accessible. Better yet, your virtual office promises can provide your business with the platform for growth in an online reality. Virtual offices, for startups especially, can be a saving grace in an office market that usually shuts out the small guy.

Let’s take a closer look at the reasons why a virtual office is the best solution for your startup.

Cost-Effectiveness

The virtual office is probably the most cost-effective for startups because your business only needs to worry about paying for IT services and access to meeting and conference rooms on a pay-as-you-go basis. The immediate benefit to businesses is that more of their budget can be allocated to other expenses outside of rent and other bills associated with overheads. In addition, the virtual office lease is not as protracted as standard office leases and don’t require as much money in initial startups costs.

Versatility

The virtual office also provides businesses with the ability to use the office format in a number of different ways. For one, the online format is flexible enough to allow businesses to expand their operations online, if necessary. The online landscape is limitless and as your business grows you do not have to worry about trekking through Indonesia’s office space terrain to find affordable, appropriate office space. The plans versatility is also seen in how the virtual office can be used to explore other markets in the Asia Pacific. As opposed to travelling to distant locations, your virtual office can provide you with all the stats you need before making the trip.

Online Infrastructure

With the virtual office, businesses have the freedom to create a structure for their office however they see fit. If your business is a smaller one, then you might only rely on a few file sharing and communication apps to manage your startup. Alternatively, larger businesses will find that using online business management software is more effective in communicating with employees, tracking assignments, with managing payroll, and with a host of other tasks commonly associated with running an office.

Performing Public Relations

The online platform is great in that in no way has any vehicle shown that self-promotion can be so profitable. Just look at some of the more popular video-streaming sites to see people relating to the public and building an online presence. In the same way, your business can dispense with old methods of using print ads to connect with the public.

Social media and other platforms have made it possible for businesses to personalise their company’s ideals with the public. For Indonesian businesses, the virtual office in many ways can use social media to establish a discourse with the public, essentially to relate to the public. Add in the numerous creative online ads and promotional ploys and your business can establish your brand’s identity.

Going Virtual

Beyond saving oodles on office supplies, the logistics of your virtual office provides your business with the benefits of using online space for your office format. In doing so, your office can be used in a number of ways and functions, namely to explore other markets. More significantly, your virtual office in Jakarta or any other city can be the platform for establishing your business in the international market."

Grab to Invest $250 Million in Indonesian Startups in Race Against Go-jek

Grab will invest $250 million in Indonesian startups over the next three years through its newly launched innovation arm, as the ride-hailing firm aggressively pushes to cement its position in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.

The Singapore-based firm has raised $2 billion in funding in recent months and also launched the Grab Ventures arm to develop technology start-ups in sectors beyond ride-hailing as it locks horns with Indonesia’s Go-Jek for regional dominance.

“We are looking at startups in both series A and B, which we could integrate into our ecosystem,” Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director for Indonesia, told Reuters.

The company, which counts Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp among its backers, has already started looking at startups and will start funding rounds later this year, he added.

Grab is interested in healthcare and food-and-grocery delivery startups as well as those that facilitate digital payments and automated processes, he added.

Grab’s rival Go-Jek has already evolved from a ride-hailing service to a one-stop app allowing Indonesian clients to make online payments and order everything from food, groceries to massages. It is now looking to expand in Southeast Asia, to Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore.

Kramadibrata said Grab is currently the top ride-hailing player in Indonesia and that he was confident the firm would be able to maintain the lead. The firm is valued at around $11 billion, according to sources.

“We hold 65 percent of (Indonesia’s) ride-hailing market, as based on total rides and transactions,” said Kramadibrata. “And it won’t stop there, our market share is increasing.”

He reckons Grab holds majority market share in 137 cities in Indonesia, compared with Go-Jek’s roughly 50.

Kramadibrata said he based his estimates on internal and third-party data that he declined to reveal.

Go-Jek did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Its CEO, Nadiem Makarim, told Reuters this month that the company’s app was a market leader in Indonesia, processing more than 100 million transactions for 20-25 million monthly users.

He did not specify how many of those transactions were only for ride-hailing.

Ride-hailing services in Southeast Asia are expected to surge to $20.1 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025 from $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a Google-Temasek report.

McKinsey noted that e-tailing, or business conducted online through e-commerce firms such as Blibli, Tokopedia, Bukalapak and Lazada, will likely amount to $40 billion by 2020, while transactions on social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Line, WhatsApp and Blackberry Messenger, may reach anything between $15 billion and $25 billion.

Total e-commerce sales in Indonesia amounted to around $8 billion last year, with $5 billion of that from e-tailing.

McKinsey also noted that 83 percent of internet users are expected to make online purchases by 2020, compared with 74 percent currently.

The business consultancy interviewed 60 experts, ranging from chief executives of publicly listed companies, small and medium business owners, startup owners, former ministers to heads of government agencies, across the archipelago.

The company also surveyed nearly 3,500 people, including 700 online merchants, 500 offline merchants, 2,000 online buyers and 250 dropshippers.

""We conducted this research because we saw that there are rarely surveys out there that offer comprehensive reports on e-commerce. This particular sector has a real impact on the country's economy,"" Philia said.

This is McKinsey Indonesia's first e-commerce survey.

Social Impact

McKinsey said e-commerce has had a positive impact on job creation and social equity in Indonesia.

As the largest e-commerce market in the region, Indonesia could generate about $20 billion in online sales by 2020, compared with $2.5 billion today.

This projection shows that online sales in the coming years will also come from regions in Indonesia that are currently untapped.

The business consultancy projects that e-commerce will support 26 million jobs both directly and indirectly by 2020, compared with 4 million now.

Meanwhile, buyers can also save money through e-commerce. People living outside Java can expect to pay between 11 percent and 25 percent less for goods online, compared with brick-and-mortar shops.

Buyers living in Java can save between 4 percent and 14 percent, McKinsey said.

The business consultancy said e-commerce can also improve gender parity and financial inclusion.

Challenges

McKinsey noted that there are five key challenges if Indonesia wants to boost its e-commerce sector.

The government should ensure that logistics and infrastructure are reliable. Indonesia still trails behind many other countries in terms of infrastructure development and it ranked in 63rd place among 160 countries globally in 2016, according to the World Bank data.

Online payment systems meanwhile also play an important role in the growth of e-commerce. However, only 49 percent of Indonesians currently have access to financial services, compared with 85 percent in Malaysia and 82 percent in Thailand.

McKinsey said while the internet is key to building a strong digital ecosystem, only around 60 percent, or 36 million small and medium business in Indonesia currently have an online presence. Of those, only about 15 percent have online ordering and payment systems, which shows an urgent need for small business owners to implement reliable technology and payment systems.

Aside from that, McKinsey said Indonesia also faces a technical skills shortage. The country only produces eight science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates per 1,000 citizens, while China produces 34 and India 20.

Supportive Policies

McKinsey further noted that supportive government policies also play an important part in boosting the country's digital economy.

Indonesia revised its negative investment list in 2016 to allow 100 percent foreign direct investment in e-commerce, if the investment exceeds Rp 100 billion ($6.8 million).

The government is also committed to improving the country's infrastructure, prioritizing the building and upgrading of ports and roads to lower logistical costs.

""The focus on infrastructure projects must be continued, especially to improve access to rural areas,"" Philia said.

The government further established several agencies to support the digital economy, including the Bank Indonesia Fintech Office last year and the National Creative Economy Agency (Bekraf) in 2015."

Please email Travel Tech Editor Sean O'Neill at so@skift.com if you have funding news.

The total funding publicized this week was more than $8.5 million.

>>Kimkim raised a total of $3.7 million in a series of seed investments.

The Palo Alto-based company had disclosed a $1 million seed investment in 2016. The other $2.7 million has been raised since then, with the biggest piece — $2 million — coming from Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Launched in December 2015 as HiveTravel, the service quizzes a consumer on what kind of trip they may like, introduces the user to a local travel advisor to finalize the details, and then facilitates the transaction.

CEO and co-founder Joost Schreve has past experience in the industry. He previously founded and sold EveryTrail, a location-aware tech company, to TripAdvisor in 2011 and eventually rose to become vice president of mobile product at the online travel company.

Several companies have attempted to mix human agents with online booking and have struggled to gain traction. Mobile booking through travel agents never broke through for well-funded and staffed Lola, which is moving to a corporate travel service. Flightfox, another effort at matching travelers with human “travel hackers”, also ended in a pivot to corporate travel.

Leisure-focused Kimkim has nine employees. “Our gross booking volume passed $1 million per month recently, growing nicely at a pace of about 2.5 times, year-over-year,” Schreve said.

>>Travello, an Australia-based social travel app, raised $3.6 million ($5 million Australian) in funding from a consortium of investors.

CEO and co-founder Ryan Hanly said the company has 350,000 travelers using it to share tips and browse more than 50,000 bookable in-destination activities.

Launched in January 2015, Travello debuted in the wake of a decade of many companies attempting to build a “Facebook for travel.”

The only one of these that gained significant traction was Gogobot, which had raised $39 million in funding and last year was acquired by Ctrip.com and its sister price-comparison brand Skyscanner.

Another company, Where Are You Now (WAYN) was acquired for $1.2 million by Lastminute Group in 2016, despite having raised $11 million from investors.

Another, Triposo, was acquired last year by Musement for an undisclosed sum.

Hanly said this time is different for social travel. The short answer is timing. “Travello probably would have met a similar fate to WAYN if it was developed even five years ago,” Hanly said. “The timing just wasn’t there, but the concept was sound.”

He added that mobile-only Travello can take advantage of some changed factors, such as the rise of last-minute bookable destination activities and the rising behavior of social sharing via apps like Instagram.

Travello is neither a marketplace nor a travel planning tool, which often struggle because of their infrequent use case. Travello has focused on community development instead. “That’s a distinct point of difference to the Klooks and even TripAdvisor — which has lost its community feel.”

Commissions from recommending tours and activities, which are mostly booked in-destination, will be the company’s eventual revenue focus, Hanly said. Travello also hopes to make money by helping companies in-destination enjoy visibility with qualified customers.

This is Travello’s second round of funding, having closed a $900,000 ($1.26 million Australian) angel round. The company faces competition from players such as Trekteller, which claims to have close to 50,000 active users.

>>Travelstop, a Singapore-based business travel startup, has raised $1.2 million in seed funding.

SeedPlus, a Singapore-based firm connected with Jungle Ventures, and an undisclosed travel-focused venture capital firm based in the U.S., led the equity round.

The travel ecosystem is disjointed, with various inventory suppliers and agencies trying to sync with hundreds of different systems, assimilate the information, and provide the best possible experience for the end-user in an Asian context of different languages and currencies.

As of today, Travelstop — which has a dozen workers and is hiring for more — is building its product for small- and medium-sized Asian corporates with a focus on Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

CEO and co-founder Prashant Kirtane previously co-founded Travelmob, a vacation rental search site that was acquired by HomeAway/Expedia a few years ago. Kirtane co-founded Travelstop in November 2017 with two other entrepreneurs who also had worked at TravelMob.

Skift Cheat Sheet:

We define a startup as a company formed to test and build a repeatable and scalable business model. Few companies meet that definition. The rare ones that do often attract venture capital. Their funding rounds come in waves.

Seed capital is money used to start a business, often led by angel investors and friends or family.

Series A financing is typically drawn from venture capitalists. The round aims to help a startup’s founders make sure that their product is something that customers truly want to buy.

Series B financing is mainly about venture capitalist firms helping a company grow faster, or scale up. These fundraising rounds can assist with recruiting skilled workers and developing cost-effective marketing.

Series C financing is ordinarily about helping a company expand, such as through acquisitions. In addition to VCs, hedge funds, investment banks, and private equity firms often participate.

Series D, E and beyond These mainly mature businesses and the funding round may help a company prepare to go public or be acquired. A variety of types of private investors might participate.

Startup funding for the Lion City hit $7.23b in 2017 alone.

Singapore received the most investments for startup fundings in Southeast Asia as total investments bound for the Lion City hit $11.47b (US$8.4b) from 2013 to 2018, a study by venture capital (VC) firm Monk's Hill Ventures and tech startup event Slush Singapore.

In terms of volume, Singapore's 888 deals also leads in the region. According to the study, Singapore received more than 50% of all SEA deals in four years of the past five years. But in 2017,Singapore's volume of startup investment slid a little to 45% of all the region's deals.

The report also noted that Grab received a sizeable investment for the fundings bound for Singapore as it raised $2.47 (US$2b) from China's ride-sharing firm Didi Chuxing and Japan's Softbank.

Following Singapore's lead is Jakarta which received ($2.18b) US$1.6b for 228 deals from 2013 to 2018. In 2017, startups in Singapore received almost three times as much funding as their Indonesian counterparts where it received $7.23b (US$5.3b) compared to Indonesia's $2.32b (US$1.7b) worth of startup funding.

""The SEA tech ecosystem can always use more venture capital, particularly those from high-quality VC firms with value-add and relevant strategies, regardless of whether the firm is a homegrown or an international one,"" Monk's Hill Ventures founder and partner Kuo-Yi Lim commented. ""Hopefully this raises the bar in the venture capital community and keeps the current players on their toes."""

Grab will invest RM1bil in Indonesian startups over the next three years through its newly launched innovation arm, as the ride-hailing firm aggressively pushes to cement its position in the South-East Asia’s largest economy.

The Singapore-based firm has raised US$2bil (RM8.2bil) in funding in recent months and also launched the Grab Ventures arm to develop technology start-ups in sectors beyond ride-hailing as it locks horns with Indonesia’s Go-Jek for regional dominance.

“We are looking at startups in both series A and B, which we could integrate into our ecosystem,” Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director for Indonesia, said.

JAKARTA, NNC - Minister of Communication and Information, Rudiantara aspires Indonesia to have 10 unicorn startup companies by 2020.

""There will be a thousand startups in 2020, and 10 unicorns,"" said Rudiantara, during the Grab 4 Indonesia event in Jakarta, Wednesday (8/28/2018).

The Ministry of Communication and Information and KIBAR have a 1000 Digital Startup program to encourage the development of the digital industry in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Indonesia has four startups classified as unicorns, which are those that have a valuation above US$ 1 billion, namely GO-JEK, Bukalapak, Traveloka and Tokopedia.

Rudiantara sees that there is one challenge in the Indonesian digital startup world, namely the lack of technical talent.

To overcome this, the Ministry of Communication and Informatics tries to provide education scholarships to Beijing and Bengaluru in an effort to accelerate the growth of unicorn startups in Indonesia.

The Minister also stated that Indonesia needs foreign investment that could provide added value, not only to make Indonesia a market.

The government, he said, is open to discussing taxes and incentives for foreign investors who want to invest in Indonesia."

As his JD.com sets its sights on global expansion, he's turning to others for help: Google and Walmart. Just a few months after Google bought a $US550 million ($749 million) stake in JD, Liu said he's in the early stages of strategic planning with the search giant to win customers outside its home market. Walmart will work with JD to expand operations in China, the US and Southeast Asia, Liu said. JD ranks behind only Alibaba when it comes to e-commerce in China and has started pushing into physical stores in the country, although its incursions overseas have mostly been limited to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. But Liu has his eyes on the affluent consumers of Europe and the US as he makes substantial investments in the infrastructure needed to supply millions of customers around the world. ""Our ambition is to expand our supply chain ability to the whole world - to connect any brand, any goods and any consumer globally,"" Liu said in an interview at a business event in Aspen, Colorado last month.

Walmart and JD have already teamed up in China as Liu agreed to buy the US company's online operations in the country. In return, the Bentonville, Arkansas retailer bought a stake in the business. Walmart also co-led a $US500 million fundraising in August for JD affiliate Dada-JD Daojia, which connects fleets of motorbike delivery staff with merchants in hundreds of Chinese towns and cities.

Liu said that while its partnership with Walmart would be global, any work with Google would be ""mostly focused outside of China."" Most of Google's services are either blocked or unavailable in China. His initial edge over Amazon.com and other foreign rivals would be the ability to bring cheaper, high-quality Chinese goods abroad followed by the expansion of its supply chain, he said. The international push comes at a challenging time, with JD shares slumping amid rising costs, competition and an expensive expansion that now sees the company operate 11.6 million square metres of space across 521 warehouses in China. Wayne Peters, chairman of Peters Macgregor Capital Management and a shareholder in JD.com, said that investment is an incredibly valuable asset for the company's future. ""Richard under-promises and over-delivers,"" said Peters. ""What we like are CEOs who look to the long term. We're more interested in that than those who are just interested in beating the street. ""

Liu's high-spending strategy also has plenty of detractors, especially those who see unfinished business in China. JD's share price hit a record high in January only to tumble more than 35 per cent since then after failing to deliver the full-year profit that many analysts had expected. In the June quarter alone, the company had a net loss of 2.2 billion yuan. Kok Hoi Wong, the chief investment officer for APS Asset Management Pte in Singapore, points to the massive profits generated by Alibaba and its willingness to throw cash at winning over Chinese consumers as proof that competition is getting harder for JD. ""JD must get its act right in China, turn it around and make it profitable before it expands internationally,"" said Wong, a frequent critic of the company. Brutal competition among hundreds of e-commerce players means business is tough for all online retailers and ""we will see more blood before we see more profit."" he said. ﻿

JD's business model is more akin to Amazon than Alibaba. It holds and sells its own inventory and also allows other vendors on its platform while its larger Chinese rival provides a marketplace for merchants and makes most of its money from advertising and marketing services. Liu expects some changes to his business as it goes overseas, accepting the need for different models. Simply replicating its China strategy and launching a service in a foreign country won't work. ""If we want to convince American consumers to download JD's app and buy, I think it will be hard. But the good thing is US has Twitter, Instagram and Facebook - a lot of social media,"" said Liu, adding he wants to partner with those social networks in particular.

Liu is in the process of opening more offices and adding warehouses across Western Europe and will form a strategy for selling products in the region this year, Liu recently told German publication Handelsblatt. Within two years JD will cover all of Southeast Asia, he added.

At home, JD has a goal of 1 million convenience stores within five years largely via a franchise model. But the founder said he also wanted 30 7Fresh supermarkets completed by the end of 2018 and that it will also expand into JD-branded furniture, electronics and home appliances chain stores with names like “JD Home.”

But it’s a vision Liu knows will take some time to build.

“We will spend another 10 or maybe 20 years to expand to the whole world. So you cannot achieve a goal within three years or five years,” he said, adding that he thought JD was a better bet than Alibaba. “From an investor perspective it is – more space for tomorrow.”

Coinhako launched its trading platform in Jakarta in August because Indonesia has so much ""growth potential,"" Coinhako co-founder Yusho Liu told the Nikkei Asian Review in an interview. He noted that there are already about 1 million Indonesians who are trading in bitcoin, which remains legal in the country.

But for Liu, the real prize would be tapping the market for using cryptocurrencies to make payments among Indonesia's huge unbanked population. ""I think [the unbanked] is where cryptocurrency can have impact,"" he said, without making a prediction about whether cryptocurrency payments will ever be made legal in the country.

Coinhako is just one of the many ""fintech"" startups flocking to Indonesia. The Indonesian Fintech Association said there are more than 200 fintech companies in the country, including the 31 e-payment providers that have secured licenses from Bank Indonesia and more than 60 peer-to-peer lending companies registered with the Financial Services Authority.

On the back of President Joko Widodo's digital economy ambitions, the top two fintech sectors -- e-payment and P2P lending -- have been enjoying exponential growth in the past few years. The value of e-money transactions grew sixfold between 2012 and 2017 to 12.3 trillion rupiah ($840 million). The amount of P2P loans disbursed doubled to 6.2 trillion rupiah between January and May this year alone.

The president has set a target of making Indonesia the largest digital economy in Southeast Asia by 2020. This entails an annual e-commerce transaction value of $130 billion and the creation of 1,000 tech startups with a value of $10 billion, among other things.

This has translated into government support for ride-hailing apps like Go-Jek and Grab despite continued resistance from conventional taxi operators, as well as assistance for fintech startups.

The freewheeling atmosphere has been intensified by well-heeled investors from outside Indonesia who are pouring money into the market, turning four of the country's startups into unicorns.

Since its launch of mobile wallet Go-Pay in April 2016, Go-Jek, Indonesia's first unicorn, has raised more than $2 billion through three funding rounds.

In August 2016, it raised $550 million from KKR, Warburg Pincus, Sequoia and other private equity funds. In February, it closed a $1.5 billion funding round from investors including Tencent Holdings, JD.com, Google, Temasek and local conglomerate Astra International. In April, German insurance company Allianz Group announced a $35 million investment in Go-Jek.

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding led an investment of $1.1 billion in online marketplace Tokopedia, another local unicorn that has created its own e-payment service, TokoCash. In March, Alibaba launched mobile wallet Dana with local media company Elang Mahkota Teknologi.

Despite still seeing fintech companies as potential threats, Indonesia's major banks are also investing in local startups. Bank Mandiri has invested in P2P lending startups Amartha and KoinWorks through its venture capital arm Mandiri Capital Indonesia.

But not all is rainbows and sunshine. Worried about potential systemic risks to the economy, Bank Indonesia has enacted policies some see as restricting market access. In May, the central bank issued a regulation capping foreign ownership in e-money providers at 49%, which may explain its suspension of some e-wallets like TokoCash and GrabPay, a mobile wallet originally used by Singapore-based Grab, since they submitted license applications late last year.

The ban on cryptocurrency payments has also forced Jakarta-based blockchain startup Pundi X to postpone its domestic ambitions. The company -- whose mission is to become ""the Walmart and 7-Eleven of cryptocurrency"" and ""make buying cryptocurrency as easy as buying bottled water"" -- is expanding aggressively elsewhere. It recently announced the opening of a South America head office in Brazil and sales of its point-of-sales devices for cryptocurrency transactions in Colombia.

Despite lingering regulatory risks, Indonesia Fintech Association chairman Niki Luhur believes working together with regulators is the best solution.

""They care about consumer protection, systemic risk, shadow banking, terrorism financing ... all things that we care about as well,"" Luhur told Nikkei in May. ""Sometimes the issue is communicating with the same vocabulary.""

The Singapore-based firm has raised $2 billion in funding in recent months and also launched the Grab Ventures arm to develop technology start-ups in sectors beyond ride-hailing as it locks horns with Indonesia’s Go-Jek for regional dominance.

“We are looking at startups in both series A and B, which we could integrate into our ecosystem,” Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director for Indonesia, told Reuters.

The company, which counts Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp among its backers, has already starting looking at startups and will start funding rounds later this year, he added.

Grab is interested in healthcare and food-and-grocery delivery startups as well as those that facilitate digital payments and automated processes, he added.

Grab’s rival Go-Jek has already evolved from a ride-hailing service to a one-stop app allowing Indonesian clients to make online payments and order everything from food, groceries to massages. It is now looking to expand in Southeast Asia, to Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore.

Kramadibrata said Grab is currently the top ride-hailing player in Indonesia and that he was confident the firm would be able to maintain the lead. The firm is valued at around $11 billion, according to sources.

“We hold 65 percent of (Indonesia’s) ride-hailing market, as based on total rides and transactions,” said Kramadibrata. “And it won’t stop there, our market share is increasing.”

He reckons Grab holds majority market share in 137 cities in Indonesia, compared with Go-Jek’s roughly 50.

Kramadibrata said he based his estimates on internal and third-party data that he declined to reveal.

Go-Jek did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Its CEO, Nadiem Makarim, told Reuters this month that the company’s app was a market leader in Indonesia, processing more than 100 million transactions for 20-25 million monthly users.

He did not specify how many of those transactions were only for ride hailing.

This initiative is an addition to its IDR10 trillion (US$700 million) Grab 4 Indonesia’ 2020 Master Plan, which aims to support the country’s goal to be Southeast Asia’s largest digital economy by 2020

The launch of Grab Ventures in Indonesia follows its regional launch in June in Singapore. It will partner or invest in startups who want to solve mobility, food, logistics, fintech and other O2O challenges.

The goal is to form strategic partnerships with these startups and possibly integrate them with Grab’s platform, advancing the company’s ambitions to become an everyday app (for example, by integrating delivery services provided by partnering startups).

Part of Grab Ventures Indonesia’s plan includes a 16-week accelerator programme called Grab Ventures Velocity, which will help startups in their scaling stage — both nationally and across Southeast Asia.

Grab Ventures Velocity is a joint venture with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kominfo), Creative Economy Agency (BEKRAF). Its partners include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and MDI Ventures, Telkom Indonesia’s corporate venture capital initiative.

122;782519469;20180828;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/23368/indonesia/indonesia-blockchain/;"Indonesia’s tech scene has finally hit its stride, and the industry is now rife with startups and tech businesses that aim to solve problems unique to the Indonesian ecosystem.

One area of tech of high interest in Indonesia is blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies that have taken the world by storm in 2017. The technology is the up and coming tech trend of 2018 it seems, and Indonesia already has a strong hand in this pie, starting with startups like those featured here.

Within the past few months, there have been huge industry-changing developments in Indonesia’s blockchain that could, with proper cultivation, bring blockchain development into a more prominent, streamlined and potentially disruptive stage in Indonesia.

1. Bank Negara Indonesia Now Use Blockchain for Trade Finance and Remittance

Those in the know have said for years that blockchain can be used to streamline many legacy systems prevalent in finance, with immutability as a key point of interest for any processes that involve more than one organisation. Taking these lessons to heart, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) has decided to incorporate blockchain technology for trade finance and remittance products.

The central bank has already taken their leap in May this year with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Treasury and International Director, Rizal Budidarmo and the CEO of PT Adamobile Solutions Networks, Adam Suhermanin.

The central bank will be the first in the nation to apply blockchain technology.

Rico Rizal Budidarmo, MD in BNI, said that: “The use of blockchain in trade finance transaction can provide easiness in the form of document access and validation that can be done in real time through an integrated system among its members.” “While for remittance transactions, among them is for real time and sage data exchange as the data has been encrypted to all of the blockchain members.”

2. Indonesia Launches Its Very Own Blockchain Hub

Earlier this month, an Indonesia Blockchain Hub was just launched as a dedicated space to help the promotion and development of blockchain technology.

The Indonesia Blockchain Hub’s goal is to bring together the different Indonesian Blockchain communities, to drive innovation, and to provide education on blockchain technology. It is supported by HARA, a blockchain for social impact project, the Indonesian Blockchain Association (ABI) and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the government agency BEKRAF.

Yos Ginting, member of the supervisory board of the ABI said, “We believe that the set-up of a place like Indonesia Blockchain Hub will accelerate the exchange of information. It can be used to [help] make Indonesia a country that will reap the benefits [of blockchain technology] as early as possible.”

“I think this is the time where our agency can help to support and to foster the blockchain ecosystem, and most importantly we will become the government agency that will echo the importance of the blockchain ecosystem to the other government institutions as well.” Regi Wahyu, CEO of HARA said, “This is a historical moment for Indonesia. This shows that Indonesia is ready for blockchain technology. The Indonesia Blockchain Hub will have a huge effect on how the blockchain ecosystem will grow in Indonesia.”

Having a centralised location for blockhain startups and experts to congregate can be a great way to bring the industry’s brightest minds together, particularly to create solutions that are unique to the Indonesian people.

Both developments mark important stages for Indonesia’s blockchain—BNI taking such a hard stance on blockchain could be the key motivator Indonesia’s banks need in order to take blockchain development seriously.

Meanwhile, the launch of the Indonesia Blockchain Hub could help cultivate important blockchain discussions unique to the nation, and most importantly, streamline the whole operation into one focused vision.

P2P Lending Fintech May Contribute Rp25tn to GPD, Indef Says

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) said that fintech-based companies offering peer-to-peer lending services can improve Indonesia's macroeconomics capability.

Indef's review, done together with the Indonesian Fintech Association (Aftech), estimates that fintech development in Indonesia can contribute up to Rp25.97 trillion to the GDP.

Speaking at the discussion with the theme ""Lending Fintech Roles to Indonesia's Economy"" in Jakarta, August 28, Indef economist Bhima Yudhistira Adhinegara said that the Rp25.97 trillion contribution includes both direct and indirect impacts.

""This shows that fintech's existence has elevated the macroeconomics,"" he remarked.

According to the Financial Services Authority (OJK), P2P fintechs have disbursed Rp7.64 trillion worth of loans. To date, there are 66 fintech companies licensed by and registered with the OJK. Another one has just obtained the regulator's approval to run its business.

It is said that Jakartans spend 10 years of their life in traffic. The populous and fast growing Indonesian capital city is a sweaty, gridlocked cacophony of just about every type of vehicle you can think of.

It’s a problem that has been noticed, and tackled, by the region’s tech entrepreneurs. To this end, two massive tech “unicorns” dominate the ride-hailing market there.

Both companies, Go-Jek and the Singaporean Grab, are effectively the Ubers of that region.

In fact, both companies have been so successful that they brought the worldwide ride-hailing leader Uber to its knees, forcing the San Francisco company to effectively bow-out as a standalone company at the beginning half of this year.

This is no small deal. Indonesia, with more than 260 million people, is the fourth most populous country in the world. The entire Southeast Asia region where Uber waved the white flag (by closing shop and taking a minority stake in rival Grab) is a market of about 620 million people.

One of the biggest criticism of tech startups is that they create businesses with a Silicon Valley mindset

And in this the tale of faraway Jakarta is a lesson for tech entrepreneurs here in South Africa, and everywhere in the world.

Local vs Silicon Valley

One of the biggest criticisms of tech startups is that they create businesses with a “Silicon Valley mindset”. Entrepreneurs, tech entrepreneurs in particular, often specialise in creating high-tech copies that are just irrelevant for the local market.

It is something venture capitalists look for in businesses. When assessing a potential investment, a key question venture capitalists ask is: “What is your competitive advantage?” or even “What is your unfair advantage?”

They are looking for that thing that will make your business special and make it fly (and therefore make a return on investment).

We all know the internet is international and it’s a dream to create a global business and travel the world. But these are hard to do, and in most cases it’s better to stick to the market you know, understand, and have your network in. It’s the market you have a competitive advantage in, why would you throw that away?

Woven into South Africa’s local idiosyncrasies and complexities, is the local entrepreneur’s worldwide competitive advantage. To not see this, is to squander your biggest headstart.

Entrepreneurs often note with despair that strong, well-funded multinational companies have already moved into their local market and are completely dominating the sector.

In South Africa we have Uber (transport), Google (search and advertising), Netflix (video streaming), Facebook (social media and online advertising) and many others.

So how can we compete with the great Uber, they ask?

Go-Jek’s answer

Well, in Jakarta, the Go-Jek founders had some answers. From the very start, the Indonesian company reasoned that the best way to address the city’s traffic jams were to bet on the more affordable and appealing ojek (or motorcycles) rather than cars.

GoJek also offers cars, but nimbly teamed up with a 20 000-car-strong local taxi provider, rather than start from scratch.

To ensure its vehicles were used beyond rush-hour traffic, Go-Jek then switched on about 18 other on-demand services, quickly expanding beyond ride hailing to include delivery services involving food, grocery, medicine, ticketing, general logistics, cleaning services — even massage and beauty options.

There is a South African twist to this impressive story. Via its Tencent stake, Naspers is an indirect shareholder in the company.

And what a stake it is: the fast-growing eight-year-old “startup” is now worth about $5-billion, is recognised as one of Indonesia’s top 10 brands and appears at number 17 in Fortune’s list of 50 companies that Change the World, alongside tech titans like Microsoft and Apple.

Solving SA problems

Go-Jek teaches us that the great local startups of the future will be those that solve real South African problems. And there are some great local startups doing just that.

For example, the five-year-old Cape Town startup Sweepsouth aims to improve and disrupt the hiring process in the informal domestic worker sector through technology.

There is Luvuyo Rani’s Silulo Ulutho Technologies, which incubates and educates township entrepreneurs.

Snapscan is a mobile payment solution company that facilitates transactions in a range of sectors and industries, but it has filled a particularly useful micro-payments niche allowing parking attendants to collect money.

Noting that 75% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa live and work in areas that have limited access to goods and services, logistics startup Pargo provides last-mile courier services to companies for those hard-to-reach informal areas.

Spazapp is a funded Durban-based company whose android application connects a community of informal traders directly to big FMCG companies like Unilever and Tiger

Brands.

In the healthtech space, Vula Mobile connects healthcare workers in remote areas and the patients they serve to medical specialists, speeding up the referral process.

These are just a few of many local startups solving real South African problems. We need more of them.

Indonesians are among the world’s most avid users of social media, in a country with a rapidly growing digital ecosystem of online commerce, ride-sharing services, media distribution, financial services, and more. While these factors have created significant business opportunities and new jobs, improved access to services, and promoted greater connectivity with global society, Indonesia must still overcome several challenges to become a truly digital economy.

Exhibit 1

While many reports have examined the recent growth of digital in Indonesia, none has offered a comprehensive, end-to-end look at its impact on the real sector—the part of the economy that produces goods and services—and on the country as a whole. McKinsey Indonesia has undertaken research to explore the impact of online commerce (defined as consumers buying and selling physical goods online), now an $8 billion-a-year sector that affects local manufacturing directly. This report explores the dynamics of the digital economy through the lens of online commerce, spelling out priority measures necessary to unlock Indonesia’s broader digital economy.

Indonesia’s online commerce accounts for at least $8 billion in consumer spending (Exhibit 1). In 2017, the country had about 30 million online shoppers, approximately 15 percent of a total adult population of 195 million.

We examine the socioeconomic impact of that market, today and five years from now, by evaluating its financial benefits, the benefits to buyers, and the impact on job creation and social equality (Exhibit 2). Our forecast indicates that online-commerce sales will grow eightfold, with formal e-commerce reaching $40 billion and social commerce up to $25 billion by 2022. Thirty percent of this activity will involve new consumption that would not have occurred otherwise, and the market will support up to 26 million full-time-equivalent jobs in 2022. In addition to raising revenues, online commerce can have a broader social impact: for example, we found that 35 percent of online sales are generated by women and that online commerce has led to savings of 11 to 25 percent for customers outside Java.

Exhibit 2

Overall, five key success factors that underpin thriving online-commerce ecosystems elsewhere indicate that Indonesia has room for improvement in all areas: reliable logistics and infrastructure; seamless, secure, and scalable payment opportunities; a digital-commerce ecosystem for professionals and for micro, small, and midsize enterprises; a strong talent pool; and a healthy investment climate.

Indonesia’s online commerce journey Take a look into the largest online commerce market in Southeast Asia.

To overcome the challenges facing Indonesia in online commerce, priority moves include resolving logistical bottlenecks, encouraging more cashless payments, and getting more micro, small, and midsize enterprises online. Ultimately, Indonesia can apply the lessons learned from online commerce to boost its broader digital economy.

The successful digitization of Indonesia’s economy will rest on the ability of the public and private sectors to fill the country’s yawning talent gaps, on the ability of midsize companies to bulk up so they can take better advantage of the global export opportunities that digital platforms offer, and on the government’s ability to encourage transparency in the digital arena, particularly by creating a digital impact index. Addressing these fundamental issues will enable Indonesia to truly harness the power of the digital economy.

It provides easy to use tools that simplifies the business travel booking process, while automating expense reporting and providing meaningful insights to business owners.

Michael Smith Jr., Partner at SeedPlus says,

“Travelstop is led by an experienced team of founders who have significant experience in solving complex consumer problems. 90% of all business travel in Asia is unmanaged and Travelstop, with its modern approach to business travel, is perfectly positioned to be the leader in this space. Now, with Travelstop, companies across Asia can easily manage their travel needs and offer their employees who travel a delightful user experience.”

The Asia Pacific region is the largest business travel market in the world, comprising 40% of global business travel, and is on track to grow at 10.4% CAGR between 2015 – 2023 (Europe 3.8%, US 4.1%). While current business travel solutions are designed for large corporations and traditional business travellers, the unmanaged travel space in Asia, which is increasingly dominated by millennials, needs a simpler and more flexible solution: one that keeps costs low, allows a level of flexibility and gathers all data and expenses into a single, easy-to-use interface.

Travelstop addresses this gap by providing a platform that simplifies business travel booking and automates the expense reporting process for employees. It uses advanced machine learning and AI-powered personalisation to make flight and hotel recommendations, reducing the hours needed by business travellers to research and book their travel. Employees also have access to an intuitive expense reporting tool that simplifies the expense reimbursement process.

Prashant Kirtane, Travelstop CEO said:

“Young Millennials and business travellers in Asia are technology savvy, socially driven and are smart travellers that actively participate in the sharing economy. These travellers aspire for more meaningful travel experiences, and we at Travelstop are building a modern business travel platform for the next-gen traveller. Our goal is to not only provide a delightful and flexible travel booking experience, but also make the post-trip expense management process more efficient.”

Travelstop plans to bring all the product innovation happening in the consumer space to the enterprise world—leveraging technologies such as machine learning and AI-driven personalisation to build a compelling and modern experience for today’s business traveller.

Travelstop CTO, Vijay Aggarwal says,

“Business travellers deserve to experience all the innovation and progress that the consumer space has made over the last several years. Our goal is to leverage machine learning and AI to power experiences for today’s business traveller, while staying nimble and flexible by investing in modern infrastructure to power our platform.”

Kirtane further added

“This round of funding will be used to drive product development, build a world-class development team in Singapore, and to ramp up growth through sales and marketing. In 2018, we will focus our energies on a few priority markets like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and will look to expand beyond these markets in 2019.”

129;781741160;20180824;2018;http://nowjakarta.co.id/indonesian-startups-thrive-in-the-global-market;"These days, Indonesia has been an incubator for startups in many sectors, from the culinary arts to transportation. The emergence of these startups is strongly supported by technology that is growing rapidly.

Today, a number of Indonesian startups have successfully expanded their business to the international level. Here are a few of them:

Gojek

The company founded by Nadiem Makarim has successfully become one of the Indonesian startups that has had a positive impact on the daily lives of Indonesians, offering practical solutions to the lack of public transportation in the city. In the early days of the business, Gojek aimed to provide a solution for motorcycle operators who rent a ride (ojek pangkalan in bahasa) by placing ojek into a booking system platform.

Named as a Unicorn Startup, Gojek is now valued at around USD 1 billion. Starting with Go-Ride, online ojek services that can be ordered at any time and from anywhere, the Indonesian startup that was established in 2010 developed other features that are useful for everyday life, transform the application with one-stop life gear. The business extend to taxi service Go-Car, Go-Food for food delivery, Go-Mart for wholesale shopping, and even Go-Clean for home cleaning services.

Because of its success, Gojek received an injection of USD 550 million from an international consortium. In addition, GO-JEK also managed to get the ASEAN Entrepreneur Award from the World Knowledge Forum in Seoul, South Korea in October 2016. This Indonesian startup is not only successful in its own country, but also has grown extensively by opening a representative office in Bengaluru, India.

Traveloka

Traveloka, an Indonesian startup that was founded by Ferry Unardi, Derianto Kusuma, and Albert Zhang, became the main choice for travel booking which provide airplane and train tickets, as well as accommodation reservation such as hotels. Recently, Traveloka introduced Traveloka Eats as the newest guide for culinary tourism.

This Indonesian startup succeeded in obtaining funding from well-known foreign companies such as East Venture, Expedia, and several other investors. The total investment is now worth to USD 500 million or IDR 6.75 trillion. Traveloka services can be not only be enjoyed in Indonesia, but also other Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam and Singapore.

Tokopedia

Tokopedia is one of the best-selling online e-commerce sites in Indonesia since it was officially launched in 2009. Useds could explore numerous products, from gadgets to clothing. Topkopedia provides a platform for independent sellers to market their products through the mobile application and website. The company, founded by William Tanuwijaya and Leontinus Alpha Edison, and it became the first Indonesian startup company to get funding of USD 100 million or around IDR 1.2 trillion from Sequoia Capital and SoftBank Internet and Media Inc. (SIMI).

In 2017, Tokopedia received an investment from a Chinese company, Alibaba, for USD 1.1 billion. Tokopedia was chosen as Provider of the Year at the Markplus Conference 2015 held by Markplus Inc. and the Best Company in Consumer Industry from the Indonesia Digital Economy Award in 2016.

Kaskus

Kaskus, known as Kasak Kusuk is a community site founded by three friends, namely Andrew Darwis, Ronald Stephanus, and Budi Dharmawan. Kaskus is almost like Reddit from the US which creates an online forum for folks to discuss anything. Founded in 1999, Kaskus has become the largest community forum in Indonesia.

The forum connects the communities, transform the platform to set the trend and even creates in-app business transaction for indie seller. In its development, Kaskus has received various awards such as The Best Marketing Driving Company, The Best Innovation in Marketing provided by Marketing Magazine and The Greatest Brand of the Decade in 2009-2010 by Mark Plus Inc."
130;781410235;20180823;2018;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimjay/2018/08/23/this-entrepreneur-uses-technology-to-solve-one-of-indias-most-difficult-e-commerce-challenges/;"Despite holding senior roles at companies like MasterCard and PayPal, there’s always been an itch inside Anurag Avula to make a difference in the world of e-commerce. Make no mistake, the companies he worked for made a huge impact. But as he surveyed the markets he was operating in, he saw a problem.

Entrepreneurs were trying to create thriving businesses without a supporting ecosystem that enabled their businesses to go online and find success. Whether it was a homemaker creating earrings in Singapore or a street vendor selling crabs in Hong Kong, the technology wasn’t there for them to easily create a fully fleshed-out business. Given his age and track record, this was not a decision that Avula made lightly.

“I have a lot of gray hair right now, and making that jump was absolutely thought through in many ways,” he recalled. “It was not impulsive like I woke up one day in the morning and said to my two cofounders, ‘Let’s go and do something.’ We knew that there was a significant opportunity for us to make a meaningful difference.”

With Yen Ti Lim and Kris Chen, Avula founded Shopmatic in 2014 to be a plug-and-play solution for companies looking to sell online, on social media or in person. As CEO, Avula has been at the helm during the company’s impressive early growth, including landing partnerships with HDFC Bank and Singtel in Singapore. But what really warms his heart are the stories he hears from merchants using Shopmatic.

“One lady from Hyderabad in India told us that she became successful because of us and that we made it happen for her,” Avula shared. “To me, there is no better feeling than when a customer writes to you and tells you something like that.”

Launching in a difficult market

Avula and his cofounders decided to launch Shopmatic in India for a couple of reasons. First, they saw a huge opportunity to solve problems for the country’s entrepreneurs. Second, they were looking for a challenge.

“India is not an easy market,” Avula said. “I’m not saying any market is easy, but India is a lot harder than other markets that you would have, considering the access or the understanding of e-commerce, technology, data infrastructure, and things like that. We took the approach that if we got India right, other markets would seem easier.”

Shopmatic launched in India in January 2016 and then followed that up with Singapore and Hong Kong about six months later. Focusing on a few markets allowed the team to nail ease of use and some other key value propositions they promised customers.

Standing Out From the Competition

Of course, to launch a product in any market requires a competitive edge. In the eyes of Avula, what makes Shopmatic different from other e-commerce platforms?

“One is our overall value proposition,” he explained. “We want to provide the entire ecosystem for anyone wanting to sell online. That means creating storefronts, having a payment gateway and a logistics provider, and integrating shipping into the platform. It also means being able to sell across multiple marketplaces, be it Amazon, eBay, Lazada, Rakuten or any other marketplaces where our customers operate.”

Shopmatic generates its revenue from a subscription product called Shopmatic Pro and through shares the company gets from payment platforms when customers opt to use the free version of their product, Shopmatic Go. The company expanded into the United Arab Emirates in July and plans to launch in Indonesia and the Philippines before the end of the year.

“We’ve got some established growth numbers in the three markets that we operate,” Avula shared. “So I think we’re ready and primed for our next phase of growth. In effect, we want to be in 20 different countries in the next 24 months.”

Advice to Entrepreneurs

For aspiring entrepreneurs, or those like Avula who are considering making the leap, he advises not waiting for the perfect time. Why? It will never come.

“I think there’s never a right time,” he said. “If you keep waiting, something will happen that will make you say, ‘Let this pass, and I will think about it then.’ If you do that, you’ll be back to square one. If you believe in something and your ability to make it happen, the right time to get started is now. Don’t let your moment pass by.”

For entrepreneurs ready to take the leap, Avula cautions them to expect the unexpected.

“You need grit, persistence, and the belief that whatever comes your way will pass,” he said. “Even with the best laid plans, you’ll get curveballs coming at you from all sides.”

Finally, he encourages aspiring entrepreneurs to pick their partners wisely.

“There is courage in numbers,” he said. “If you have a partner or a couple of other partners, do it together, because every single day will not end with you being on top of the world. You will feel depressed. You will feel dejected. In those moments, you’ll need somebody to step in and say, ‘We’ll figure this out. We’ll take this forward.’”"
131;781115652;20180822;2018;https://www.indonesia-investments.com/finance/financial-columns/rapid-development-of-fintech-industry-in-indonesia/item8949;"Based on data from Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (in Indonesian: Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or OJK), disbursement of credit through fintech in Indonesia this year reached IDR 7.8 trillion (approx. USD $534 million) up to the end of July 2018. These funds originate from 66 local fintech companies that have obtained permits from the OJK to engage in peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending).

Riswinandi, Executive Head of Financial Sector Monitoring at the OJK, stated that so far this year credit disbursement through P2P lending in Indonesia has soared 204.7 percent compared to the IDR 2.56 trillion (approx. USD $175 million) that was disbursed in full-year 2017. Riswinandi added that there is plenty of room for further growth for Indonesia's fintech industry as is demonstrated by the fact that 62 other local fintech companies are currently lining up to obtain permits from the OJK in order to start their business.

Hendrikus Passagi, Fintech Licensing and Supervising Director at the OJK, said his institution will continue to monitor the country's fintech industry in a strict manner. Therefore, the OJK recently revoked the operating permits of five fintech companies as their shareholder compositions had been changed without first seeking the OJK's approval.

Meanwhile, at the start of the week the OJK officially launched the OJK Innovation Center for Digital Financial Technology (abbreviated: OJK Infinity) at the OJK's headquarters at the Wisma Mulia 2 building in Central Jakarta. OJK Infinity is designed to be the place where stakeholders, regulators, government, and academics can cooperate and discuss ways to improve the development of Indonesia's fintech industry, while at the same time strengthening consumer protection.

A healthy development of fintech companies across Indonesia should result in an improvement in the nation's financial inclusion. Indonesia forms a huge consumer base with a population that numbers over 260 million people (moreover it is characterized by a rapidly growing middle class). However, dozens of millions of Indonesian households lack access to financial services. Meanwhile, many more lack awareness in financial services.

The low level of financial inclusion in Indonesia actually jeopardizes financial system stability in Southeast Asia's largest economy (while encouraging growth of a shadow economy). A negative effect is that low financial inclusion leads to exclusivity. Thus, only a small percentage of people will understand - and have access to - financial products and services. With such exclusivity, third party funds in the financial industry of Indonesia will not grow to the maximum. This will cause the intermediary function of the financial industry to stagnate and therefore becomes an inadequate cushion in the event of a recession. Meanwhile, it will further widen the level of economic inequality in Indonesia.

Tight monitoring is indeed required as the OJK recently discovered there are more than 100 unlicensed P2P lending providers active in Indonesia. Out of a total of 227 unlicensed P2P lenders, at least half originates from China. This is most likely due to the Chinese government's tightening measures on curtailing illegal fintech companies at home. Moreover, Indonesia is a lucrative consumer base for such companies.

Since Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia, many smaller ride-hailing startups have started mushrooming to capture a piece of the market largely dominated by Grab."
134;780932461;20180821;2018;https://www.startupticker.ch/en/news/august-2018/over-300-brands-in-italy-rely-on-qiibee;"The Zug based blockchain startup qiibee has won Italy’s retail association, Confimprese, as its partner. Confimprese’s members include fast food giant KFC, coffee maker Lavazza, and the largest publishing house in Italy, Mondadori as well as Disney and Agip. Qiibee’s loyalty services have already been offered to Confimprese’s 300 members, with negotiations ongoing.

Confimprese is the leading Italian Retail Association, made up of modern trade companies with franchising and direct networks. The association has over 300 commercial brands. The association counts over 30,000 points of sale, 600,000 operators, and its member companies account for 16% of total retail turnover.

The association is aiming to boost and further develop the retail industry in Italy with the help of the Zug startup qiibee. The startup - with offices in Israel, USA and Indonesia - helps brands around the world run their loyalty programs on the blockchain.

It offers a qiibee Protocol, which enables businesses to issue real valued loyalty tokens that can be combined and traded. Reward and redemption transactions are stored on the blockchain and remove the central data authority. The protocol not only enhances security, it also allows customers to earn real value by enabling them to sell their loyalty tokens for other cryptocurrencies or fiat”.

The Swiss start-up and the Italian association have signed a partnership agreement allowing qiibee to offer its services to Confimprese’s members. Negotiations wit potential customers are already ongoing.

“Having worked in the retail industry for more than 20 years, I have witnessed industry challenges, opportunities, and trends that go hand-in-hand with running a business. What qiibee are doing is revolutionary, and I am convinced that this is the type of development that is necessary for the next generation of retail companies in Italy to evolve,” said Mario Resca, President of Confimprese.

“Within the qiibee ecosystem, customers will always have full control of, and transparency about, their loyalty programs and tokens. We want to offer Confimprese and its member brands the possibility of engaging with blockchain technology without the need for cost-intensive integration for brands or an upfront investment for customers,” said Gabriele Giancola Co-founder and CEO of qiibee.

MUMBAI -- Indian startup MyCrop Technologies has produced a mobile app that it says can help raise agricultural productivity in Asia and beyond, benefiting both farmers and consumers.

Co-founder Deepak Pareek returned recently from Iran, invited by the government there to test the feasibility of the MyCrop Tech platform for farmers. The app uses big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide insights on how to increase yields, the best crops for a given type of soil and the timing on when to grow them.

About 2,000 farmers in India and a similar number in the Indonesian province of North Sumatra use the application. It operates in the languages of Hindi, Gujarati and English in India, along with Bahasa and English in Indonesia.

The company is talking with governments and stakeholders in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines to introduce the platform in those countries, Pareek told the Nikkei Asian Review in an interview. He also has been approached by authorities in Kenya to test the platform there. Spain is another potential market, the tech entrepreneur said.

Pareek sees this geographic diversification as a way to avoid ""putting all the eggs in one basket,"" balancing the uncertainty around government policies in any one country.

Deepak Pareek, founder of Mycrop

""By next year, we hope to bring on board some 10,000 farmers,"" said Pareek, who has worked for institutions such as the Export-Import Bank of India and Tata Honeywell. He holds a Master of Business Administration degree from Regis University in the U.S. city of Denver.

The app is free for farmers to use. MyCrop charges a fee for making data on what and how much farmers are growing available to fertilizer companies and financial institutions, instead of levying the farmers themselves.

Most projects the company plans to enter receive government funding, so MyCrop requires little capital. The company is sustainable, but might need investors to grow in the future, Pareek said. With the current 15% month-on-month growth, he expects to generate $100,000 in revenue by December.

He started MyCrop Technologies in 2016 with friends and entrepreneurs Paresh Shah and Vinesh Patel, all of them hailing from western state of Gujarat. Pareek left a two-decade career, looking into education and agriculture as outlets for his technological expertise before focusing on farming.

Before incorporating MyCrop, Pareek visited about 10 countries, met 1,500 farmers and got involved in paddy harvesting to understand how the ecosystem works. He started with the premise that food shortages were a ""stupid problem"" that could be solved with relevant data.

Pareek noted the contradiction that farmers should face dire financial problems while 800 million people go hungry around the world.

""It is a situation where both demand and supply are there, so what can we do about it?"" he said.

Agriculture is plagued by misconceptions and miscommunication among all stakeholders, he said, including farmers, governments, financial institutions and insurance companies.

Pareek concluded that virtually everyone in farming sees only one aspect of the sector and makes decisions based on that limited perception.

""We created a platform which has all the information about the farmer: his crop, demography, which crops he has grown in the past, what he is spending, on what he is spending, on labor how much,"" he said. ""That becomes the first part of the data. The second part of the data is that typical historical data.""

The company does most of the groundwork through what Pareek calls ""Farmer Mitras,"" or village-level entrepreneurs. These Farmer Mitras earn commissions for gathering data about the farmers, their land and crop, as well as the area's climatic conditions. This data is used to forecast agricultural output through new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The startup also brings other stakeholders to its platform such as bankers, fertilizer businesses and insurance companies. Pareek reckons that a more professional approach toward agri-financing could go a long way in increasing productivity.

""Financing ... typically is more philanthropic than an actual decision taken by a banker,"" he said. ""We believe that bankers should be given correct information about a farmer as like any other client.""

Farmers should detail their costs for growing a crop, and they can rework their plans if the bank doesn't see them as viable, Pareek said. ""This way it is a data-driven decision rather than a philanthropy,"" he said.

For fertilizer sellers and other stakeholders, MyCrop offers a dashboard with information such as the crops that farmers are buying, how they are buying them and the crops already available. The dashboard can be customized to a company's needs, Pareek said.

""It can be focused on productivity, cost, labor -- we are having all this data,"" he said. The user can ""see specific farmers: what this guy is doing, at what stage he is, where his land is, what he has bought in bulk of his orders [as well as] about his land, about crop he has grown, about status of the farm plant.""

""So we are creating a 360-degree view of someone nobody wants to profile otherwise because it is too costly and not economical,"" he said."

Ping An - one of China's largest healthcare services platforms - is a recent investor in Grab. It participated in the ridehailing company's US$2 billion funding round led by Toyota that was announced in early August.

The JV is said to be the first of its kind to operate regionally. It will provide integrated medical services such as artificial intelligence-assisted online medical consultations, medicine delivery and appointment bookings through an online platform.

The JV will work with governments, hospitals, doctors and other key stakeholders, and will utilise GrabPay, Grab's digital wallet, to complete transactions. The service will launch in select countries in the first-quarter of 2019, said Grab.

sentifi.com Market voices on:

With this JV, Ping An becomes the latest partner to join GrabPlatform. Launched in July, GrabPlatform is a suite of technologies that enables partners to access components of Grab’s technology (including transport, logistics and payments) and leverage Grab’s user base and distribution network to create products or services for South-east Asia.

Jakarta-based HappyFresh is the first partner of GrabPlatform. Together, they have created on-demand grocery delivery service, GrabFresh, which was made available as a beta service in Jakarta from July, and will be available in Thailand and Malaysia by the end of 2018.

On Thursday, Grab said that by 2030, South-east Asia will become the world’s fourth-largest economy with rapidly-growing healthcare needs. ""The region faces critical healthcare challenges, such as a lack of adequate medical infrastructure in some countries, a rural-urban divide when it comes to the accessibility of doctors and inefficiencies on the consumer end when needing to see the doctor.""

Grab added that in Indonesia for instance, there is only one physician for nearly 5,000 people, a ratio that is significantly lower than high-income countries with up to three or four physicians per 1,000 people. ""Efficient and timely healthcare solutions delivered digitally have the potential to transform the industry and improve medical outcomes,"" Grab said."

Go-Jek launched in Vietnam on August 1 under the name Go-Viet and is expected to launch in Thailand in the fall. The company had said it would also expand to Singapore and the Philippines.

Asked about Singaporea's response to negotiating for the expansion of Go-Jek, however, he said, ""Go-Jek is not as applicable in Singapore, it's a small market.""

A spokesman for Go-Jek declined to comment.

Malaysia's ride-hailing platform Grab and Singapore-based e-commerce company Lazada are among the other Southeast Asian unicorns.

Thomson Reuters Foundation

Communities, campaigners and conservationists are increasingly using crowdfunding rather than relying on charities and governments to finance their programmes, according to researchers.

In a recent analysis of nearly 600 projects that have raised about $4.8 million in total, researchers led by Eduardo Gallo-Cajiao at the University of Queensland found that money largely went to Indonesia, South Africa, Costa Rica and Mexico.

The funds came mostly from the United States, Britain and Australia, the researchers found.

The money went to research, on-ground actions such as tree planting, and persuasion – including awareness campaigns or resistance to deforestation and industrialisation, said Gallo-Cajiao.

“Crowdfunding is pluralising conservation – it is no longer just about big non-profits and government agencies that have traditionally dominated the conversation,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday.

“It is allowing smaller players such as local community groups to back causes they care about, and get results.”

Crowdfunding is growing in popularity worldwide as a means to finance innovative products, assistance after disasters, medical procedures and even college degrees.

Environmental causes – from planting trees to cleaning beaches – are a relatively new focus area, but gaining in popularity quickly, with dozens of dedicated websites.

In India, crowdfunding has restored village ponds in drought-stricken areas. It is being used to clean up public alleys in Southeast Asia and build homes for indigenous people.

In Korea, the startup Tree Planet has tapped K-pop fan clubs to crowdfund forests that are dedicated to their favourite bands.

More than 1.1 million people have contributed to planting over 770,000 trees in a dozen countries, said co-founder Jeong Min-cheol.

“Everyone likes trees, and understands they are good and necessary for the planet,” Jeong said.

“Crowdfunding allows even individuals to give small amounts for a big cause they may not otherwise have known about – and then brag about it on social media.”

The startup has crowdfunded a “memorial forest” for Korean victims of sexual slavery in World War Two, and planted trees in Mongolia to check desertification, and mango trees in South Sudan for livelihoods, Jeong said.

An ongoing campaign provides funding to plant coffee bushes in Nepal to help farmers devastated by the 2015 earthquake.

While money from crowdfunding for environmental causes is “modest”, it is empowering people who previously had little agency and enabling access to capital in places where it is scarce, Gallo-Cajiao said.

“It is lowering access barriers, overcoming bureaucratic challenges, funding initiatives that would not be funded otherwise, and expediting fundraising in times of urgency,” he said.

“It is also sparking more innovation, as proponents are not constrained by priorities set by traditional funding agencies.”"

Imported Product Skyrocket Since E-Commerce Boom in 2015

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Darmin Nasution said the recent growth of e-commerce triggered the increasing enthusiasm of shopping among the community, as the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) recorded that the public consumption index continued to grow.

The household consumption index also reached 5.14 percent. The figure was better than that of in the past few quarters which declined to 4.94 percent.

""Yes, [the growth is] due to e-commerce sector, people in urban areas prefer to shop via sophisticated tools,"" Darmin said in his office, Monday, August 6.

However, the government planned to regulate the way people shopping through telephone or internet, especially the spread of imported goods at online outlets.

The government was currently speeding up the signing of Government Regulation Draft (RPP) on Trade through Electronic Systems. The Communication and Information Minister Rudiantara said the RPP would at least regulate the licensing, data transaction, and a certainty of sales for local business actors.

""It will be ready in the next month or two,"" said Rudiantara last weekend.

The number of public consumption was reflected by the hike in imported goods. The consumption rate was increased over the years. The US $ 8.9 billion or 7.2 percent of the total the US $ 118.1 billion of non-oil and gas imports in 2015 was the imported consumer goods. In 2017, imported goods accounted for 9 percent of total imports of US $ 156.8 billion or the US $ 14 billion.

The BPS Head Suhariyanto said that the surge in online shopping activities in the past few years had a positive impact on the sector of the transportation and warehousing industry. The logistics industry had become one of the most positive industrial sectors.

""Transportation and warehousing grew to 8.59 percent in the second quarter,"" Suhariyanto said in his office yesterday.

The Indonesian Logistics Association also confirmed that e-commerce played a role in supporting the logistics sector. The association head Zaldy Masita said the demand on goods delivery was quite soaring.

""Moreover, many e-commerce companies give subsidies for shipping costs despite the number is somewhat decreased this year,"" he said. Since the e-commerce boomed in 2015, the sector's gross domestic product grown from 170 to 185 in the quarter II of 2018.

The Institute for Development of Economics and Finance Executive Director, Enny Sri Hartati, said the government was urged to move quickly to secure the market for domestic players in e-commerce. ""The domestic products may be further excluded by imported goods,"" said Enny.

Since the adoption of the Green Revolution — between 1965 and 2015 — India’s food production has multiplied 3.7 times, resulting in a 45% increase in food production per person, making India self-sufficient when it comes to food and an exporter as well. But one-fifth of India’s farmers’ still live below the poverty line.

The Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre has announced its commitment to doubling farmers’ income by 2022, an ambitious plan that could do with a leg up and more from technology.

In remote villages in Gujarat in India, a handful of Farmer Mitras are doing just that. These Farmer Mitras (friends), appointed by agritech startup MyCrop, roam agricultural fields in the area, collecting data across various agricultural parameters. The information is then uploaded on an app developed by MyCrop built using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for predictive analysis of farming output.

The Farmer Mitras are also tasked with mentoring smallholder cultivators in the latest farming techniques and technology. The aim is to help farmers decrease farming costs and increase productivity and income, says founder of MyCrop, Deepak Pareek, adding the startup is also helping generate employment for youth in these villages by onboarding them as Farmer Mitras.

Interestingly, MyCrop started started its operations abroad — in the Southeast Asian island nation of Indonesia — before launching in India. It is present in Java and North Sumatra, where it has appointed 21 Farmer Mitras. Back home in India, there are 14 Farmer Mitras working in 28 villages in central Gujarat.

“The Farmer Mitras collect data related to land, including geofencing, along with the demographic profile and past crop information of every farmer in the villages where we’re active. Based on the information churned using our AI-powered application, they guides farmers on what to grow, when to grow, and how to grow it,” says Pareek.

The projects have started showing fruitful results, Pareek claims, adding the startup has helped farmers increase their productivity by 30%, thereby enabling them to decrease their cost of production and increase their incomes.

For instance, agri-lenders can use the platform to evaluate farmers’ performance, their land quality, and their farming behaviour to take effective decisions related to disbursal and follow-up of agri loans. Meanwhile, agri-input companies can take effective market-related decisions. Such data-driven insights can even help the government formulate better policies.

“These (farm) plans help farmers do better than what they were doing yesterday. We’ve been able to reduce their cost of cultivation and increase their yields, profitability and income,” Pareek says.

Similarly, food aggregators, agri-import companies and distributor can use predictive insights on farmers’ productivity manage their own stocks better. This, in turn, can enable farmers can avail good prices for their produce.

“We can even sell the produce before the harvest because we can predict its growth. This whole ecosystem is delivered to the farmers free of cost,” Pareek said.

Farmer Mitras: Making A Career Of Data Collection And Mentoring

MyCrop handpicks tech-savvy locals and appoints them as village level entrepreneurs (VLEs) or Farmer Mitras. It trains them and tasks them with collecting data related to farmlands and crops, which is then uploaded on the AI-powered MyCrop app to draw actionable insights.

“We’ve worked a lot in creating a good training module that is universal. We give a complete career plan to the Farmer Mitras,” Pareek says.

The Farmer Mitras are taught to collect important information related to the demographic profile of farmers and their land and crops, among others, along with images. The data is then collated with geo-spatial factors (climate, topography, etc). The startup also draws on information from third-party services — for instance, historical financial and land data.

All of this data is processed using ML and AI to predict agricultural output. On the basis of these predictive insights, MyCrop draws up customised end-to-end farm plans covering the crop lifecycle for farmers. The plans are simple and include recommendations on what crop varieties a farmer should plant, the number of days he should spend on different farming activities (sowing, irrigation, application of crop nutrients, crop protection, harvesting), and other relevant inputs.

The Farmer Mitras visit farms periodically helping farmers implement their cultivation plans and post updates on the MyCrop platform through pictures of the current crop status. They also educate farmers through video, pictures, and information on their MyCrop tablet about actions to be taken.

According to Pareek, Farmer Mitras hired by MyCrop in India are earning nearly $150 USD (around 10,000 INR) every month while following their passion to serve farmers.

The startup maintains that unless it finds at least one candidate passionate enough to

help farmers in his/her respective villages, who is also adept at using mobile phones and tablets, it doesn’t add the village to its portfolio.

MyCrop: Sowing The Seeds Of Growth, From Indonesia To India

Founded by Pareek along with two other co-founders — Paresh Shah and Vinesh Patel — MyCrop first launched its pilot in December 2016 in North Sumatra in Indonesia. Now, the startup is offers its solutions through 21 Farmer Mitras across 32 villages in the country."
144;777302305;20180806;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/22095/indonesia/cashless-indonesia-e-money-card/;"Indonesia’s cashless experiments in Jakarta has yielded interesting results. By 2017, many of the industry’s observers were already discussing the possibility of Indonesia transforming into a cashless nation, and this impression has held on until this year.

And transportation is seemingly leading the fold towards cashless.

In certain areas, using public transport can all be done with e-money. Not to mention, there is a sharp increase in cashless transactions for homegrown Go-Jek and Grab, who are either paving the way for cashless in Indonesia, or simply reaping its benefits. Since both companies offer food delivery as well, the movement towards cashless is a promising one.

In fact, Indonesia is in the midst of developing Jakarta’s MRT and LRT systems which will be fully cashless, as well as the One Card One Trip (OK OTrip) programme which would allow you to switch between busses, minivans and trains with just one card, and one flat rate.

The cashless bug has bit beyond just Jakarta. Some examples, like the Mandiri’s e-money and e-cash, uses it’s card and wallet respectively to reach out to the unbanked populations of Indonesia with the goal of serving as a replacement to normal bank accounts.

While there is a lot of support, both from the higher powers, telcos, banks and fintech startups, a question remains: is the Indonesian public taken with the concept of cashless?

Based on a little bit of digging, while things are promising, we have some concerns.

Promising Still Remains a Promise

Go-Jek and Grab reported a sharp increase in cashless adoption on their rides, but World Bank reports that only 27% of 2017’s transactions comprised of digital payments. Meanwhile, debit card ownership has only reached 31% of the population in 2017.

Credit cards do not fare any better either.

Curiously though, 61% of Indonesia’s consumers prefer cashless compared to cash, as recorded by Statistica.

Perhaps the discrepancy can be boiled down to Indonesia’s merchants who are not yet on board with the cashless trend. While cashless can be more convenient for the consumers, admittedly this does require a bit of setup from Indonesia’s vendors. Merchants, especially smaller merchants, can find it difficult to apply for EDC (electronic draft capture) which for the longest time, is the only cashless option available for Indonesia to adopt.

So while the many transportation-based initiatives have converted the public, it will remain to be seen if merchants this year are coming aboard as well. But efforts are underway. For one thing, Indonesia’s Cashlez developed a mobile POS (point of sales) system which can be installed quite quickly, and accepts most bank cards, including debit, Visa, and Mastercard.

The card reader uses an app on the merchant’s phone which can be installed. It accepts most cards from different banks, including debit, Visa, and Mastercard.

Like China, Indonesia’s Cashless Saviour May Be Online Shopping

With Indonesia’s e-commerce sales expected to increase by 91% from 2018 to 2022, Indonesia’s new breath in cashless may actually boil down to online shopping.

The availability of relatively niche items, as well as the cheaper price point of e-commerce products could serve as another great educator for cashless in Malaysia. When it comes to popular websites such as Tokopedia, the merchants would automatically be on board the cashless train without them needing to port into a card reader.

After all, it was the e-commerce boom in China, the cashless dream of many nations, that partly led to the natural e-wallet growth. It’s no coincidence that Alipay is one of the top guns in the nation, and affiliated with China’s e-commerce goliath Alibaba.

Seeing the success of e-commerce in neighbouring nations like Malaysia and Singapore, it can be surmised that Indonesia would take to online shopping as well.

For Indonesia to compete on a global scale, it is crucial for the nation to adopt the ever popular cashless trend that the world’s fintech has moved towards. This was perhaps why Indonesia leads in financial inclusion, and saw a big increase in adults with bank accounts from 36% in 2014, to around half in 2018.

Between 2014 and 2017, Indonesia also saw the biggest account ownership increase of any emerging economy in the East Asia and Pacific region.

The problem though, is that many Indonesians consider proximity to banks a big hurdle.

Meanwhile, 69% of this segment owns a mobile phone—a huge opportunity for a non-bank digital money storage solution to swoop in.

This is perhaps why the Indonesian e-wallet scene has been described as saturated . The problem though, as we’ve outlined for the Malaysian markets, is that too many options may actually impede the public’s adoption, especially if it’s a new technology the ecosystem isn’t familiar with yet.

At the very least, we know that there is a majority of Indonesians who are supportive of the government’s vision towards a cashless society. Once the nation does find a system that works, that will be the expected cashless boom that has been the prediction of many observers, and finally put Indonesia on a global fintech scale.

Other financial investors included Cinda Sino-Rock Investment Management Company, All-Stars Investment, Vulcan Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Macquarie Capital.

The investment by these leading global financial institutions was a reflection of their belief in Grab’s long-term growth opportunity, according to a media release from Grab, along with the company’s ability to unlock the region’s growth potential through its industry-changing O2O and transportation platform.

Ming Maa, president of Grab, said: “We are honoured to welcome these top-tier financial institutions into our roster of strategic investors and partners. Grab is today the industry-changing O2O platform that enables millions of consumers and entrepreneurs to come online and drive the digital economy in Southeast Asia. We have seen overwhelming interest from global strategic investors and partners who are keen to partner with us to capture the region’s booming growth.”

Grab will use the funds to expand the range of O2O services it provides in Southeast Asia as it seeks to grow into the “everyday super app of choice for million in the region,” said the release.

Through its partnerships, Grab can now offer users a one-stop solution for some of their key daily needs, including the GrabPay app to pay merchants, GrabFood for ordering food, GrabExpress for sending parcels and Grab’s range of transport services to hail rides.

In July, Grab launched its vision to become the region’s everyday super app of choice through an open platform strategy. It also announced the launch of GrabFresh, an on-demand grocery delivery service in Jakarta, Indonesia with other cities to follow later in 2018.

In particular, Grab will use a significant portion of the proceeds from the current fundraising to continue investing in Indonesia, where it is the industry-changing on-demand transport booking company. Grab has over 7.1 million micro-entrepreneurs on its platform, more than half of them residing in Indonesia.

Through Grab’s partnership with

local wallet and rewards programme, OVO, Grab has formed that country’s

most widely accepted mobile payments ecosystem, with more than 60 million downloads.

GrabFood has grown exponentially this year, expanding from Jakarta to serve 28 cities and towns across Indonesia, winning significant market share with gross merchandise vValue (GMV) in Indonesia almost quadrupling in the first half of 2018. Similarly, GrabExpress GMV in Indonesia has more than doubled in the first half of 2018."

“We use ‘reverse virality’ to fight false news and misinformation propagated via WhatsApp, Facebook and other social media channels,” said Siva Nadarajah, Co-founder and investor of the US-based company.

‘Reverse virality’

The term ‘reverse virality’ combines crowd-sourcing with social networking, enabling anyone to participate in submitting and verifying false news and misinformation. Through the platform anyone can anonymously submit suspicious messages found on social media, he said, adding that the company has hired a team of journalism students locally to do ground reporting on the message.

It also employs an internal team that uses tools such as reverse image searches to validate claims. The correct version goes through another round of verification before it is shared in the same medium where it was found. “We also invest in localised Facebook advertising targeting the neighbourhood where the news spread,” Nadarajah added.

Chennai launch

For instance, the company recently advertised in Perambur, in Chennai, where the news of a teacher kicking kids in a school there was going viral.

“We found that it was a video from Egypt recorded two years ago. Using Facebook advertising, we spread the correct version in Tamil so that we could reach more people,” he said.

The video was viewed by over 40,000 people in the area. The start-up launched the platform in Chennai two weeks back and is planning to expand to other cities in coming months.

There are also plans to launch in Sri Lanka, Brazil and Indonesia by September. Nadarajah said the areas are selected based on research conducted by the company on the prevalence of fake news.

Business model

This start-up is a not-for-profit platform.

For Verify.Wiki, the revenue comes from enterprises and brands, which is yet to be commercialised in the US. Nadarajah said he started the company in 2016 along with another co-founder when he saw major brands such as consumer health brands having issues dealing with fake news in the US.

The company launched a platform where enterprises can create profile and share trusted content on the platform.

Verify.Wiki then shares the content through its community of registered users in different social networking platforms for a fee.

The platform is still in pilot mode in the US."

Robert Pasicko works for UNDP’s Alternative Financing Lab

ISTANBUL, Turkey, Aug 2 2018 (IPS) - Hardly a day goes by in the development world without hearing the term “platform”. Like in the business world, it’s becoming harder for any development organization to provide a single service or product that will make broad impact. Airbnb doesn’t build homes, it creates a network that brings together host and guests.



Likewise, it’s impossible to eradicate poverty – a complex phenomenon – without connecting different areas of expertise and partners across a wide range of thematic issues. And it’s often the case that the people we’re trying to pull out of poverty are closer to the problem and entitled to have a say about the solution.

While building platforms doesn’t happen overnight, it’s highly likely you’re already working in ways that resemble that. Take crowdfunding: it helps diversify funding, involves target groups, and mobilizes experts from all walks of life. I’ve led 35 crowdfunding campaigns at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 2015 and mobilized $1.2 million. Our field offices are working on $7 million worth of campaigns. So here’s my take-away:

• Think broad. Turning old development methods on their head, crowdfunding enables development institutions to sit at the same table with everybody else –people from poor neighborhoods, governments, startups, banks and large donors, and of course crowdfunding marketplaces. To survive in the 21st century, development organizations must diversify their contacts with partners that are ready to research, test and scale up solutions to complex problems.

• Build your ecosystem. Get a better understanding of the national context. Study the legislation and bring on board national partners who already have local connections to crowds. The more partners are able to latch on and add value, the higher the chances of success. Think of yourself as the app store: when developers come in and launch their own apps, you’ve created a virtuous circle in which the parts bring exponentially more value into the whole.

• Link up with tech platforms. Through crowdfunding we’ve supported lots of UNDP tech-based platforms, like LiveLebanon.org, GreenCrowds in Ecuador, or YemenOurHome. We’re working with them to move away from online donations, towards building communities that can deliver long-term impact. It’s not enough just putting a “donate” button on your page. These online communities can be powerful starting points for continuing to rally investors and partners.

• Partner with cities to achieve quick wins. London is creating a city for all Londoners through crowdfunding. Madrid has its own crowdsourcing platform. We’re transferring these practices to some unlikely places like Somalia, working with the diaspora to help people in Mogadishu create revenue, and withstand violence and disaster.

• Go solar: it’s the ultimate platform initiative. It’s not development if it isn’t green. Funding solar is the ultimate way to hit multiple SDG targets. We teamed up with over 30 crowdfunding platforms to deliver Citizenergy, which helped invest € 40 million into clean energy. With UNDP Moldova and Sun Exchange, we are also developing a $1 million solar plant using cryptocurrencies.

• Support small businesses – It’s hard for SMEs to get and repay their credit. But our experience in Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Morocco and Turkey has shown that crowdfunding can be a great way to get new businesses off the ground. By the same token, development organizations should intensify their work to bring crowd-funders, businesses, third party verifiers and others together to make business more inclusive.

• Use new sources of financing. In the Muslim world, Zakat (donations) are worth 200 billion to 1 trillion. We’re now working with the Islamic Development Bank on a proposal to fund NGOs. In Indonesia, UNDP is designing a brand new platform that will – among other things – use Islamic finance to help the country achieve the SDGs.

• Build networks to help people recover from disaster. Campaigns such as GoFundMe and YouCaring are putting a face on individuals affected by disasters and mobilizing global funding. The Connecting Business Initiative is taking that approach further, mobilizing business networks so they too can get involved.

Crowdfunding is the originator of all modern development platforms. When we turn to platforms, we direct money where it is most needed. People can crowdsource the best ideas and vote for them. Governments and donors can match the funds collected, financing projects citizens actually support.

In an increasingly networked age, it’s not only capable of unleashing significant impact. It can also inspire thousands of development organizations around the world to rally partners and contribute to global causes more effectively."

In this interview, Paul William Coutts discusses how the company is investing in infrastructure and innovations to facilitate the growth of e-commerce across the region.

What is the potential of ASEAN and how important is e-commerce in the development of trade and consumer spending in the region?

The first thing to recognize is Singapore's legacy, its history as a trading port for not only ASEAN but also for the rest of the world. It all started 200 years ago and, today, it is still interesting and very relevant. People started to come through Singapore either as a destination market, or as a trans-shipment port or airport. They still do so today as we connect the world from a product perspective and from a digital perspective.

When it comes to e-commerce, the focus needs to be around the digitalization of the business. That is what makes the e-commerce model work. When you look at a 2016 Euromonitor study, e-commerce was 7% of global trade and it is predicted to become 17% by 2021.

Southeast Asia was going to be one of the top three regions that would drive that growth.There have been similar studies that talk about how Asia-Pacific’s share of global e-commerce sales will rise from 52% to 67%. AP is booming, and Southeast Asia is a key component of that growth. When you look at Singapore's geographical advantage in terms of being able to connect quickly into Malaysia, into Indonesia, into Thailand, into Vietnam, we are very well-placed to act as a partner for companies operating in this area. We can take a lot of the technology innovations that we have developed over the last couple of years along with some we are still developing. We can actually help develop technologies in some of those other countries as well. We can do the front-end of the supply chain: all the way from source right through delivery and into market. Either we have our own infrastructure within the country or we may work with partners. For instance, in Indonesia, we work with partners to do distribution.

The timing is good as well because Singapore is chair of ASEAN this year; and in the postal world, Singapore is hosting the ASEAN Postal Business Meeting. As vice-chair of the meeting, SingPost will help shape how the region’s postal organizations can work more closely together. We are very excited about a new e-commerce-specific ASEAN postal product called ePac that we launched early this year and is now starting to take off.

Postal organizations have a huge part to play in e-commerce. About 70% of all e-commerce packages are under 2 kilos in weight. About 36% of all e-commerce is under 26 euros, roughly $40 Singapore dollars in value. Therefore, you need very low-cost infrastructure to deliver these packages and to do so successfully. With their mail delivery networks, postal organizations tend to have the lowest cost delivery infrastructure in each of the countries in which they operate. They have the scale and the infrastructure already in place and the capability. This gives them a key part to play in the delivery of e-commerce. For SingPost, it is about making sure that we are investing ahead of the curve, considering the growth we are seeing.

We invested in a new Southeast Asia e-commerce logistics hub which we opened in November 2016. This was a ten-year investment yet it hasn’t taken us 10 years to make it productive as 96% of its warehousing capacity has already been filled. We have an automated carousel, and a parcel sortation system on the ground floor, which has the capacity to process a hundred thousand parcels a day.

What was a10-year growth strategy with that investment, we are probably going to satisfy that within three years and we may consider building more of our own infrastructure. Our goal is to be ahead of the curve so that we are able to cope with those increasing volumes. We are well-placed geographically; well-placed as a postal organization to tap into that e-commerce market, and work with other operators, not just postal but also logistics as well.

This year, 56% of Singapore Post’s revenue is driven by e-ecommerce. Your digital transformation started a while ago. Can you tell us how far along SingPost is in that transformation journey? And could you tell us more about your subsidiaries’ integration and the synergies between them?

We have a significant advantage in having two very important shareholders that are invested very heavily in those areas: Singtel and Alibaba. The ability to connect the dots across the supply chain from a technology viewpoint, as well as physical flows, impresses me. We are excited by a technology which we acquired when we invested in Jagged Peak in the US. That technology is what we called “EDGE”. It is a software solution that has been specifically designed for the e-commerce industry. It helps e-commerce companies get to market more quickly, grow their sales quicker, while controlling and reducing their unit costs over time through scalability. It is a unique advantage.

Getting back to Indonesia, for example, we wouldn’t build a last-mile infrastructure there. We would instead connect with really good partners there that have the right quality service that we need for our customer base. We will use our supply chain technology and platform at the customer front end to deliver that product into the market. This model has already been tested in the US.

We also bought another US company around the same time as we acquired Jagged Peak: TradeGlobal. We have reshaped TradeGlobal now, also using EDGE technology at the front end of the business. We are in the process of bringing those businesses together as one in the US. We have also connected our EDGE technology with our e-commerce business here in Singapore and Southeast Asia, and will expand that out into Australia, Hong Kong, China, and around the world. And we would effectively create a network out of that.

Talking about integration, it is a lot less about physical integration and a lot more about technology integration. It’s about having the whole organization working off one good market strategy, one value proposition, supported by one technology infrastructure, right across the supply chain.

What would you say sets SingPost apart from your competition? What is the real key competitive advantage that makes you the go-to partner for e-commerce in Southeast Asia?

We are an organization that is coming up to our 160-year birthday and that gives us tenure, strength and trust. We also have a bit of a start-up DNA to be agile and nimble. That is actually something driven through technology and the attitude of our people. One of the things that really excited me within the first couple of weeks of being here at SingPost was the energy within the company to innovate. The company is very entrepreneurial in spirit, which is a bit unusual for postal organizations. We do have some of that start-up mentality, paired with the right infrastructure and technology.

Another important area is to be able to handle spikes of demand. If you haven’t invested in automation to stay ahead of the curve, and if your management doesn’t have that agile DNA, then you will struggle to handle the volume when it spikes. At SingPost, we have proven our ability to handle the annual e-commerce peaks for our e-commerce customers, from the year-end festive season to Alibaba’s Double Eleven event.

What would you like to achieve in the next three to five years?

We talked earlier about the emergence of e-commerce as a key revenue and profit growth stream for our organization. There is no question about whether we want to be in e-commerce, it is more about what we need to do to maximize this opportunity that we have on the table.

Our unique advantage as a postal operator is that we have our e-commerce logistics infrastructure in place for e-commerce deliveries that would not be feasible outside the postal environment. Our shareholders are unique and we have an opportunity here to be the leading player in e-commerce logistics, not only in Singapore but in Southeast Asia. We will achieve this through a trusted, collaborative, partnership approach.

We will also help connect different markets using Singapore as a hub for innovation, for technology, for physical flows, for knowhow on how to enter and grow in those markets. This is the part we have to play as an organization. It is also about creating a leadership position, not only in terms of market share, but also in terms of intellectual property that we bring to the market. The IP that we can access and bring to e-commerce in this part of the world is our competitive advantage. We want to be viewed as the connector and as a leader – all the other things that come out of that, such as market growth, will take care of themselves."

The platform is touted as a first for Singapore and the region, according to FundedHere, an equity and debt crowdfunding company that has raised more than S$10 million for companies since its 2016 launch.

FundedX is meant to create a secondary market that provides “much needed liquidity” for shareholders of privately held companies in the region.

Daniel Lin, co-founder of FundedHere, told reporters on Tuesday: “In the private market, there is a lot of fear that if you own shares of private companies, you cannot sell those unless through a trade sale or initial public offering (IPO). Liquidity is therefore a problem.

sentifi.com Market voices on:

“And people always want out. FundedX is a centralised exchange that allows people to sell their shares, and promotes more occasions for companies to provide more exit options.”

Through FundedX, legacy shareholders such as former employees and early investors can monetise their returns. Employees with stock options seeking partial liquidity can also submit verification of ownership to participate on the exchange.

Interested investors can submit buy requests which will be processed through FundedX’s algorithm to match transactions. Once shareholders and investors are paired on the platform, the company, whose shares are being transacted, will then need to approve the sale and deal terms for the transaction go through.

Restrictive clauses include right of first refusal, company-imposed lock up periods, company veto rights and company repurchase rights.

FundedX aims to have the end-to-end process completed within two weeks, it said on Tuesday.

Mr Lin added: “We see this new platform as a complementary and natural extension of FundedHere’s current offering that will support yet another key stage of the funding cycle for emerging companies.”

FundedX plans to expand to Malaysia and Indonesia in the next 12 to 18 months, after getting the relevant licences in dealing in crowdfunding and securities in each country."

By Sankalp Phartiyal and Aditya Kalra

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering asking e-commerce and social media firms to exclusively store customer data locally, a move that could affect global giants that operate in the country such as Amazon, Facebook and its messaging service WhatsApp.

The plan, which has also raised some concerns among privacy advocates, is laid out in an undated Draft National Policy document seen by Reuters that is mainly aimed at streamlining regulation of the country's burgeoning e-commerce sector.

It comes at a time when deep-pocketed foreign players are rapidly investing in India's e-commerce market, which Morgan Stanley estimates may be worth $200 billion in a decade.

The draft policy, which was floated last week according to an e-commerce industry source, also mulls tightening scrutiny of mergers in the e-commerce sector so that even small deals that potentially distort competition are compulsorily examined by the country's anti-trust regulator.

Vinay Kesari, an independent Bengaluru-based lawyer who has advised global technology companies, said the plan was bound to ""unsettle"" the e-commerce industry ""because it is at odds with the fundamental character of the internet"".

The Indian e-commerce market is currently dominated by Amazon and local rival Flipkart that is in the process of being bought by U.S. retail giant Walmart - in a deal opposed by some local traders who fear it could drive mom-and-pop stores out of business.

Other players include Snapdeal, backed by Japan's SoftBank, Paytm E-Commerce backed by SoftBank and Alibaba Group, and Tiger Global-backed ShopClues.

Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, ShopClues, Google and Facebook did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the draft policy.

The government, according to the draft, will take steps to incentivize the storage of data of Indians locally.

""Data generated by users in India from various sources including e-commerce platforms, social media, search engines etc,"" would have to be stored exclusively in India, the draft said, adding companies could be given time to ""adjust before localization becomes mandatory"".

It also said the government ""would have access to data stored in India for national security and public policy objectives subject to rules related to privacy, consent etc"".

Raman Chima, global policy director at internet advocacy Access Now, said it was beyond the mandate of an e-commerce policy to begin talking about how all internet players should store data in India.

""It is very troubling because it would quite likely lead to intrusion on people's privacy, especially since the legal measures regarding surveilling and accessing data of people online have not been specifically reformed,"" Chima said.

DATA PROTECTION

The draft policy follows a proposal last week from a government-appointed panel that all critical personal data on people in India should be processed within the country. The recommendations by the panel will go before parliament, which is formulating a data privacy law.

Other measures listed in the e-commerce draft policy include mandating that home-grown card network RuPay be included as a payment option for online transactions.

The company owned by a group of banks competes with global payment firms like Visa, MasterCard and American Express.

India's central bank in April said payments firms such as Mastercard and Visa should within six months store data only in the country for ""unfettered supervisory access"". But U.S. firms protested and India's finance ministry has recommended relaxing the directive.

On Monday, a senior federal commerce ministry official, Anup Wadhawan, told reporters the e-commerce policy would help strike a balance between promoting business and enhancing security using data localisation.

But some disagreed. Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates, said the tone and tenor of the draft was ""more protectionist"", rather than being balanced.

""By doing this we are playing to the domestic gallery and it will send out a protectionist message,"" said Jain, whose firm counts tech companies among its clients.

The draft also said India would move to boost participation of micro, small and medium enterprises in online retail and proposed banning the bulk purchase of branded goods, such as mobile phones, by ""related party sellers which lead to price distortions in a market"".

In an article posted on the Indonesian Logistics Association (ALI) website today (30 July),the ALI Chairman Zaldi Ilham Masita said that the growth “could be above 10%”.

Masita explained why ALI is predicting strong growth – but also pointed out there are challenges to be overcome

“E-commerce in Indonesia has driven express business growth exponentially for the last five years, with a lot of new express logistics companies launching,” said the ALI chairman.

“The challenge is that there is little logistics standardisation in Indonesia, so it’s very difficult to implement automation systems that could increase productivity. Indonesia’s geography of 17,000 islands is a big challenge for newcomers from overseas.”

The article on the ALI website also quoted Yuki Nugrahawan Hanafi, the Chairman of the Indonesian Logistics and Forwarders Association (ALFI), as predicting a 10+% growth. But Yuki added that Indonesia’s logistics sector still had to address a number of issues before it could realise its full potential. Most importantly, Yuki said, Indonesia has to reduce its logistics costs, which are high in comparison to Malaysia and Thailand.

Yuki added that all the stakeholders in Indonesia’s logistics industry must “prepare themselves for the Industry 4.o” (this is the so-called Fourth Industry Revolution, which will see manufacturing and distribution transformed by Artificial Intelligence, automation and bid data)."

London (ANTARA News) - Indonesia has huge financial technology (Fintech) potential, while Switzerland is one of the world`s innovative service and financial centers.



The statement was made by Indonesian Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein Muliaman Hadad during a visit to the Crypto Valley Association (CVA) in Zug, Switzerland, Sansanti Nordewati of the Indonesian Embassy (KBRI) in Bern informed Antara here on Thursday.



The ambassador highlighted fintech developments in Indonesia while addressing CVA officials. He noted that if combined with the Swiss population of eight million, the internet network in Indonesia will connect 142 million people.



With this projection, fintech transactions will reach US$22 billion in 2018, with an annual growth of 16.3 percent.



Thus, the likelihood to cooperate in the fintech sector in Indonesia is still wide open.



The CVA is an association of hundreds of fintech companies in Switzerland that aims to build the world`s leading blockchain and cryptographic technology ecosystem.



The CVA actively supports and connects startups through joint research, policy recommendations, conferences, hackathons, and other industry events linking blockchain innovation centers in London, Singapore, Silicon Valley California and New York.



Ambassador Muliaman also elaborated on the fintech policy support in Indonesia as regulated by Bank Indonesia, Financial Services Authority (OJK), and Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, such as OJK`s peer-to-peer lending fintech and launch of the National Payment Gateway by BI online transactions for the public in Indonesia.



Meanwhile, CVA International Director S?ren Lemvig Fog, who has a wide business network in developing countries, stated that Indonesia clearly cannot be underestimated.



""Just look at Indonesia. There are four startup unicorn companies Gojek, Traveloka, Tokopedia, and Bukalapak,"" Fog noted.



Unicorn is a startup company, with assets over $1 billion.



Ambassador Muliaman Hadad`s visit to CVA in the framework of organizing the fact-finding mission in the fintech field will be held by KBRI Bern-Swiss in October. Fact-finding missions will be followed by Indonesian fintech companies to meet and explore business cooperation with potential partners, innovation development agencies, and financial services authorities in Switzerland.



Ian Simpson added that the CVA is ready to welcome potential partners from Indonesia in October.



""The extraordinary potential of Indonesia and Switzerland is expected to produce something big and mutually beneficial,"" the CVA communications director noted. *

157;775170048;20180727;2018;https://theloadstar.co.uk/indonesian-logistics-benefits-booming-e-commerce-leads-cheaper-plbs/;"Indonesia’s logistics industry will enjoy double-digit growth this year, thanks to booming e-commerce and a string of new bonded logistics centres.

According to the Indonesian Logistics Association (ALI), the industry will grow 10-12% this year, while e-commerce will expand by up to 30%.

“E-commerce in Indonesia has driven express business growth exponentially for the last five years, with a lot of new express logistics companies launching,” said ALI chairman Zaldy Masita.

“The challenge is that there is little logistics standardisation in Indonesia, so it’s very difficult to implement automation systems that could increase productivity. Indonesia’s geography of 17,000 islands is a big challenge for newcomers from overseas.”

However, he added: “The e-commerce opportunity is still wide open, with the portion of e-commerce of total retail sales still below 5% – so there’s plenty of room for further growth,”

Mr Masita is also confident Indonesia’s new bonded logistics centres (PLBs) give the country a much-needed advantage over rivals Singapore and Malaysia, where logistics costs are roughly half.

The centres act as “mini free-trade zones”, deployed strategically throughout the country, helping reduce storage costs for importers and exporters. The first 11 opened in 2016, another 50 launched last year and a second generation is under development.

“PLBs will bring regional warehouses in ASEAN to be based in Indonesia,” claimed Mr Masita. “As the biggest economy in ASEAN, Indonesia consumes the majority of products, so it makes sense if more warehousing is here to save logistics costs.

“They provide the opportunity for cargo owners to postpone duties and taxes until the goods are sold to Indonesian consumers, and also allow for goods to be re-exported up to three years later without paying any tax.”

He said PLBs could be a threat to Singapore and Malaysia, which act as regional distribution centres via their free-trade zones, if Indonesia could gain more direct air and sea links with other ASEAN markets.

“One of the strengths of the PLBs is they are all over Indonesia, so there’s no need to attach the free-trade zone complex as in other countries,” he added.

Indonesia’s director general of customs and excise, Heru Pambudi, recently claimed importers could save US$500 per container by storing goods at the PLBs instead of in Singapore, and that the policy had already drawn $606m of inventory away from the city state.

According to Sutomo Asngadi, a local trade compliance consultant, this is possible because PLBs expedite customs checks and reduce container dwell times at Indonesian ports.

“Since there is no pre-clearance activity, the container can be removed from the port to a PLB in only one day. So the dwell time is shortened compared with general imports, which still take and average of 3.36 days,” he told The Loadstar.

He said commodities currently stored in PLBs included cargo for the textile, oil and gas, mining, chemicals and automotive industries, as well as raw materials for food and beverage products.

PLBs have online licensing and permit procedures, Mr Asngadi noted, which eliminate contact with officials: “so there is no corruption”."

At least 14 selected local brands, ranging from ready-to-wear clothing, watches and socks, will be taking part in the event running at Paragon Mall in the city-state from Aug. 1 to 30.

Bekraf marketing division deputy head Joshua Puji Mulia Simanjuntak said Singapore was a prospective hub to reach the global market, especially the ASEAN market.

""Singapore is an important market for Indonesian creative industries, particularly fashion,"" Joshua told reporters on Wednesday.

""Singapore has also always been on our [list of] top-10 destinations for creative industry exports,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Bekraf deputy head Ricky Joseph Pesik said Indonesia's fashion industry had big potential to penetrate the global market thanks to its stellar growth.

In 2016, the country's exports from creative economy reached US$20 billion, in which the fashion industry contributed 54.54 percent of the exports.

“With this event, we expect higher exports from the fashion sector to Singapore,” he said.

Among the local brands being selected to represent Indonesia are Purana, Saul, Nataoka, Hunting Field, Maison Met, Pattent Goods and Woodka. (dmr)"
159;774681561;20180725;2018;https://www.regulationasia.com/shariah-fintech-a-case-study-of-indonesia/;"Fintech has undoubtedly changed the world of finance in the 21st century. Its continued growth has ushered in a host of regulatory changes in the financial industry as existing regimes now have to be adapted to fit the practice and application of end-to-end fintech products.

The world of Islamic finance, while a less-talked about industry, is not immune to the changes heralded by technology. By definition, Islamic finance, or shariah-compliant finance, refers to financial activities done in accordance to the Islamic shariah law. The main principles of Islamic finance include the sharing of risk, sharing of profits and loss, and the prohibition of interest (or riba).

It is not unsurprising that fintech has permeated the Islamic banking industry. The global market for Islamic finance is estimated to be worth some USD 2 trillion, with estimates from Ernst and Young pegging the growth of Islamic banking assets at an annual rate of 17.6 percent between 2009 and 2013. This figure was predicted to continue growing at an average rate of 19.7 percent per annum until 2018.

Notably, a survey conducted by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) in 2010 found that Islamic banks were better able to weather the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. As one of the fastest growing segments of the global finance industry, Islamic finance is a prime case for the application of fintech solutions.

Case Study of Indonesia

These developments are particularly evident in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, where in July 2018, deputy finance minister Mardiasmo plugged the term “Shariah fintech” at the country’s third annual Islamic Finance Conference in Makassar, in reference to financial technology that is compliant with Islamic laws and beliefs.

According to reports, the market share of Islamic finance remains stuck at less than 5 percent of the total finance and banking market. There is tremendous potential for Islamic financial institutions to unlock new business by catering to financial needs of halal economy stakeholders. But there are some impediments blocking this growth.

Impediments

One is the presumption that certain fintech tools might not be compliant with Shariah law. Few Islamic banks have been open to adopting new technologies because even as technology itself is neutral from the Shariah perspective, the use cases and applications of fintech still need to be compatible with the nuances of Islamic principles.

For instance, cryptocurrency was initially deemed as a violation of Shariah principles. Several notable organisations, governments and people (including the Grand Mufti of Egypt, the Turkish government, Fatwa Center of Palestine) issued edicts denouncing cryptocurrency as haram, because Bitcoin is not considered legal tender. Therefore, any innovation using cryptocurrency as a financial unit was deemed against the principles of Islamic banking.

However, in April 2018, Muslim scholar Muhammad Abu-Bakar, the internal Shariah advisor for Indonesian Islamic micro-financing firm Blossom Finance, released a study exploring the functionalities of Bitcoin, concluding that it did indeed meet the requirements of accepted payments and mediums of exchange in financial transactions allowed under Islamic principles. Following the release of the report, the price of Bitcoin rose by more than USD 1000 in 30 minutes, a jump that media outlets attributed to the increase in Muslim traders in cryptocurrency following the release of the report.

According to Mardiasmo, there is a “need to deepen understanding of Shariah knowledge” among fintech players so that they can comply with Shariah-based regulations. But interpretation of Shariah law largely depends on fatwas or on what is said by eminent scholars. Without the acceptance of fintech tools by these communities and the Islamic banking industry at large, implementation of Shariah fintech tools will continue to meet resistance.

But with fintech acceptance, we can expect to see more applications of blockchain technology in Islamic financial services, automated halal investment and trading platforms, robo-advisers in Islamic finance, smart contracts to reduce costs at Islamic financial services firms, and Shariah-compliant cryptocurrencies and ICOs (initial coin offerings).

Role of Regulation

According to a report by Global Finance Mag, global Islamic finance assets are expected to increase by 72 percent to reach USD 3.8 trillion by 2022. Much like how other financial tools operate, it is important that the use of Shariah fintech is supported by the right infrastructure and governed by the right regulation.

The need for legislation, regulation and infrastructure support is especially important because Islamic fintech firms largely operate independently, supported by complex justifications on why their innovations are permissible or endorsed by specific fatwas. There needs to be a broader understanding of the fintech industry and what can constitute it, beyond the ill-defined stance that something is only impermissible if it is in clear violation of the basic finance rules of Shariah.

In recognition of the different nature of fintech landscape, Indonesia’s OJK (Financial Services Authority) is releasing a new set of regulations to govern the country’s burgeoning fintech scene, set to come into effect in August 2018. These rules, expected to improve consumer protection and maintain financial system stability, as well as boost anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing efforts, will extend to Shariah-compliant fintech tools as well.

It is noteworthy that the primary drivers for Shariah fintech will not be the incumbent large banks but rather startups and entrepreneurs. This can also extend beyond banking, to non-bank products such as Islamic insurance, Islamic micro financing, and Islamic venture capital.

Better support and regulation for Shariah-compliant fintech will ultimately serve to boost the Islamic finance industry, increasing the share of Islamic banks in Indonesia’s financial services sector and ultimately making it more competitive.

Trade Minister to Gather Marketplaces for SME Products

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita will gather marketplaces to help the Micro Small Medium Enterprises (SME) in marketing their products. The minister previously heard that Blibli.com had only managed to sell 100,000-200,000 of 2.5 million marketed SME products.

Minister Enggar continued that he would ask the provincial office to select all of the SME products that will be marketed through the marketplace.

“The presence of this large marketplace does not make Indonesia as a market for domestic products but instead market the Indonesian products abroad,” Enggar said.

Enggar will also ask for a free of charge to get a Certificate of Origin (SKA) for the buyer. SKA is a document made by an exporter (seller) when they export goods to a particular country.

Previously, to get the certificate, the buyer must pay a printing fee but the trade minister wanted to simplify the process by shifting it to the electronic system.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — A Palestinian startup company touted as a model for Gaza entrepreneurship is struggling to recover after its office was badly damaged last weekend in an Israeli airstrike.

The office of Haweya for Information Technology was among dozens of buildings damaged on Saturday in a flare up violence between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza.

Staffers began this week to clean up the premises, sweeping the shattered glass off the floor, removing destroyed computers and printers and cleaning the dust-covered furniture.

The company was among dozens of houses, a university lab, a mosque and an art gallery damaged when the Israeli military hit what it said was a nearby training facility for Hamas.

The startup was featured in an Associated Press story in 2015 as a model of the emerging high-tech entrepreneurship trying to overcome Gaza's isolation and access restrictions.

Haweya was a rare success story in Gaza, having employed 24 young engineers, designers and web developers in a territory where youth unemployment stands at 60 percent, according to the World Bank.

Its owner and founder, Mohammed Qudih, estimated the damages from the airstrike at around $13,000.

However, buying new equipment may cost more because prices began to spike this week as Israel imposed further restrictions on the coastal strip, with new limitations on its only cargo crossing with Gaza because of the continued hostilities.

Even after Hamas agreed to a cease-fire late on Saturday, incendiary kites and balloons have continued to float from Gaza into southern Israel, setting off fires that have damaged farmlands. Israel has been battling large fires caused by the kites and balloons rigged with incendiary devices launched from Gaza. They have destroyed forests, burned crops and killed wildlife.

Qudih says the timing is ""unfortunate.""

""We are closing for a certain period that I hope won't last for long due to the damage and the materials we lost, which are essential for our work,"" he said.

""They actually destroyed the company's belongings but did not kill our ambition and dreams,"" he added.

Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized the territory in 2007. Israel says the restrictions are crucial to prevent Hamas, which is sworn to Israel's destruction, from acquiring weapons. Critics say the blockade is tantamount to collective punishment of Gaza's 2 million people.

The blockade has devastated Gaza's economy, made it virtually impossible for people to enter and exit the territory, and left residents with just a few hours of electricity a day.

The Financial Services Authority of Indonesia, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK, will launch a financial technology center in Jakarta next month, Indonesian news agency «Kompas» reports. The move is meant to foster digital innovation and development.

While Indonesia undeniably has huge potential for fintech firms, it lags far behind Hong Kong and Singapore in the nascent technology. By contrast, both of Asia's leading financial centers can claim to be thriving and open financial hubs after plowing substantial funding into creating fintech ecosystems and establishing talent pipelines.

Unbanked and Millennials

Indonesia wants to change that: Fintech has developed so rapidly in Indonesia the sector now needs further support from the government, according to Triyono Gani, OJK's head of digital finance innovation and microfinance development. The overseer will also introduce a new set of regulations covering the financial technology sector.

Indonesia's population of more than 260 million represents a sizable opportunity for the fintech industry: only 36 percent of the population are connected to financial institutions, leaving in the region of 150 million citizens unbanked.

Financial technology startups in Indonesia have been quick to address the needs of the country's millennials, where traditional banks are falling short. Millennials are projected to account for around 58 percent of Indonesia's total population by 2027."

Geneva: As e-commerce behemoths Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart battle it out for the Indian market, India and South Africa have asked whether it is proper to continue with the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

In a joint proposal circulated at the World Trade Organization on 12 July, India and South Africa said “the realities prevailing in 1998, when WTO members agreed for the first time to the temporary moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, have changed significantly during the subsequent two decades.”

“These changes,” according to the two developing countries, “necessitate a re-examination of the implications of the temporary moratorium, particularly from the development perspective,” particularly on the fiscal side.

Given the manifold increase in the volume of electronic transmissions, which initially covered only “digitized products” such as e-books, music and a variety of services, it is important to re-examine all the issues because of diffusion of additive manufacturing technology through 3-D printing as well as manufacturing physical products.

Both these trends are likely to become more prominent in the near future, thereby bringing electronic transmissions closer to the centre stage of national economies, India and South Africa emphasized.

More importantly, “as more products, which are presently traded in physical form, get digitalized and delivered through electronic transmissions, the moratorium on customs duties would result in higher revenue loss”, the two countries argued.

Major industrialized countries, led by the US, along with several developing countries such as Singapore, Korea, and Hong Kong demanded that the temporary moratorium be made permanent under the plea that it would provide predictability and certainty for goods traded through the internet. “Since 1998, WTO members have agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions. This agreement clearly requires the tariff-free treatment of digital products,” US argued, in a proposal circulated on 12 April.

“Trade rules can ensure that governments continue and make permanent the practice of eschewing customs duties on digital products,” US maintained.

It called for “non-discrimination treatment of digital products”, saying it is “at the core of the digital trading system”.

Trade rules can “ensure that these protections against discrimination apply when products are digitized and distributed electronically”.

The US also proposed a maximalist “electronics commerce initiative” for free flows of information, protection of proprietary information, digital security, facilitating internet services, competitive telecom markets, and trade facilitation through digital means.

The US’s agenda is also echoed by the European Union and other industrialized and advanced developing countries.

China is also a strong proponent of ambitious liberalization of rules governing electronic commerce.

Against this backdrop, the joint proposal by India and South Africa calling for a re-examination and re-evaluation of issues concerning the e-commerce moratorium is being supported by several developing and poorest countries because of the adverse effect on customs duties, said a South American trade envoy, who asked not to be named.

India and South Africa said there is no clarity on the scope of the e-commerce moratorium as the WTO Ministerial Declaration and subsequent decisions apply the moratorium to “electronic transmissions” but “there is no agreed definition nor common understanding among the membership of what is covered under electronic transmissions.”

“The above are issues of critical importance to most, if not all, developing countries, given the role of development and industrial policies in the digital age,” the joint proposal suggested.

Earlier, Indonesia had opposed the continuation of the moratorium on electronic transmissions at the WTO’s Buenos Aires ministerial meeting arguing that it has had an impact on customs duties and domestic companies."

The OJK’s head of digital financial innovation and micro-finance development, Triyono, said the regulation was currently awaiting approval from the Law and Human Rights Ministry.

“We will begin disseminating information [on the regulation] during the inauguration of a fintech center [on] Aug. 16. Hopefully, [the regulation] can be issued soon,” Triyono said during a discussion on Sunday, as reported by kontan.co.id.

The new regulation would only pertain to the types of fintech that are under the OJK’s supervision, which include peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, insurance technology and equity crowdfunding. Fintech such as payment instruments are under the supervision of Bank Indonesia.

“Fintech is growing very fast; it’s impossible to make one [regulation for each type of fintech]. Therefore, to regulate [fintech], we’ve drafted a [regulatory umbrella] as a means of consumer protection,” Triyono said.

He added that the important issues in the regulation included the obligation for fintech companies to register with the OJK as well as an obligation to protect consumers and periodically provide insight into their financial reports.

According to data from the Indonesian Fintech Association (Aftech), there are currently 235 fintech companies joined in the association, an increase from 165 companies in 2016.

The local e-commerce player was of the view that Google would gain access to the company’s database, which could have helped its own retail venture in the country.Walmart is picking up a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion and is awaiting a clearance from the Competition Commission of India, the fair-play watchdog.When contacted, a Google India spokesperson said, “This is all speculative and we currently have no plans to bring Google Express to India.” Flipkart did not respond to a questionnaire sent via e-mail.While there is buzz about Google venturing into India on its own, Walmart was keen to have the search giant on board in the Flipkart deal because it thought Google’s strength in building an online shopping ecosystem, along with its AI-powered speaker Google Home, could counter the threat from Amazon, with its Alexa-powered Echo smart speakers and internet-streaming services Amazon Prime Video and Music.For Walmart, the investment in Flipkart is strategic and part of its global plan to check the dominance of its rival Amazon in the retail space. At the same time, the Beast of Bentonville is looking to strengthen its footprint in India — a market it has been eyeing for a decade but has made little headway as government policy restricts foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail. Currently, Walmart operates a cash-and-carry business in India through its Best Price Modern Wholesale stores.While Walmart hopes to leverage Flipkart’s vendor base, it also has plans to use its Indonesian experience where it had partnered with local mom-and-pop stores to deepen its presence.

""We were born in South-east Asia. We live in South-east Asia. We will die in South-east Asia. And we will do everything for South-east Asia,"" Mr Tan declared on Friday, in a public dialogue with DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta at the DBS Asian Insights Conference.

He said that Grab accepted Japanese automotive giant Toyota as the lead investor in its latest funding round because ""they truly understand and localise; they've been hyper-localising"", citing Indonesia's so-called national car, the Toyota Kijang, as an example of Toyota's involvement in the region. ""That type of partnership, money cannot buy.""

Toyota unveiled a US$1 billion investment in Grab in June 2018, in a deal that would see the two companies working more closely on connected cars. The move will also see one Toyota executive join Grab's board of directors, with another team member seconded to Grab.

""The competitive advantage that we had was we chose strategic partners that could think very long term,"" added Mr Tan, noting that Grab took on partners such as Didi Chuxing in July 2017 and rival Uber in March 2018. The controversial merger with Uber's South-east Asian operations, for an undisclosed amount, also snagged Uber a 27.5 per cent stake in Grab.

""First off, why did we choose Didi and Uber? They are fellow operators, you see, so the top three global ride-sharing companies are: Didi is number one, because of volume; number two, Uber; number three, us. . . I can probably bluff you about ride-hailing, but I can't bluff these guys.""

Mr Tan added: ""So that was why we brought in these strategics versus just collecting a bunch of fragmented money. Because money was not something we needed in the short run.""

SINGAPORE -- Temasek Holdings is turning to startups and unlisted businesses as it hunts for higher returns, a strategy expected to accelerate as the Singaporean state investment company warns of increasing risks from the U.S.-China trade war.

""For a longer period of time, our unlisted assets have given higher returns than listed assets,"" Rohit Sipahimalani, joint head of Temasek's portfolio strategy and risk group, told reporters on July 10, when the investor released its latest annual report.

Unlisted assets under Temasek's portfolio reached 120 billion Singapore dollars ($88.5 billion) as of the end of March, more than double the 2013 figure. In January, the company joined Google and others in venture funding for Go-Jek, Indonesia's fast-growing ride-hailing company.

The value of Temasek's unlisted assets grew about 9% from the prior fiscal year, though the ratio of such assets in the portfolio remained similar at 39% owing to strong stock markets.

Sipahimalani called a 60-40 balance between listed and unlisted assets ""reasonable."" The risk group leader cited the need for flexibility and liquidity provided by listed assets, as well as the higher risk of their unlisted counterparts.

Early stage companies make up nearly 3% of Temasek's portfolio. These investments are expected to ""deliver higher returns in aggregate over the long term,"" the company said in a statement.

Temasek's investments during the fiscal year ended in March include innovative companies such as Impossible Foods -- a Silicon Valley-based maker of sustainable, plant-based burger patties -- and Singaporean biotech company Tessa Therapeutics, which develops cell therapies to cure cancer.

Active venture and private investments continue this fiscal year. Temasek and fellow Singaporean government investor GIC participated last month in a $14 billion funding round for Ant Financial, an Alibaba Group Holding-linked Chinese unicorn.

Temasek's net portfolio value in March reached a record S$308 billion, rising 12% to achieve a second straight year of double-digit growth. The strong global economy helped lifted share prices of investments such as Singapore financial group DBS Group Holdings, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and South Korean biopharmaceutical firm Celltrion.

Overall, the portfolio was weighted 68% to Asia including Singapore.

New investments during the fiscal year totaled S$29 billion, up 81%. Divestment declined 11% to S$16 billion. Temasek made sizable investments in listed firms as well, including Chinese tech leader Tencent Holdings and American chemical company DowDuPont. The company also invested in Boeing and Airbus, the world's two largest airplane makers.

Looking ahead, Temasek has turned bearish. ""Over the next year or two, given the outlook that we see right now, we would expect to slow our pace of investments,"" Sipahimalani said.

Temasek sees a growing probability of downside risks in the global economy for the midterm due to rising trade and geopolitical tensions and the risk of a recession in the U.S. Stringent selection of companies with higher growth potential, listed or unlisted, becomes even more crucial.

""We don't expect a full-blown trade war with punitive tariffs on a wide range of goods in a wide range of countries,"" said Michael Buchanan, senior managing director for the portfolio strategy and risk group. ""We do think, however, there will be continued tensions.""

Current tariff levels are relatively low, Buchanan said, but Temasek fears an escalation that spreads tensions beyond the U.S. and China. Companies that engage heavily in cross-border trade, ""especially those that have a lot of inter-industry goods going backwards and forwards multiple times in the production process,"" would be ""most impacted,"" he said.

Singapore's citizens watch the investment performance of both Temasek and GIC closely. The affluent but aging city-state requires more revenue to fund medical and other social spending set to rise in the long run, which heightens the pressure on Temasek and GIC to contribute more to national coffers."

Written by Dila Karinta and Bettina Herz, and published by PT Phoenix Communications, it is a compilation of in-depth interviews with founders of startups. The book provides readers access to tips and tools for aspiring entrepreneurs and aims to inspire them to develop their startup in Jakarta.

Irzan Raditya, Co-Founder and CEO, Kata.ai; Norman Sasono, Co-founder and CEO, Bizzy Indonesia; Rifki Pratomo, Founder & CEO, Andalin; and Boye Hartmann, Founder & Group CEO, Y Digital Group Asia— all of whom were interviewed for the book—were present during the launch event to share their expertise on the world of startups.

The book was the result of many discussions between authors Dila Karinta and Bettina Herz.

As the capital city of the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Jakarta serves as an attractive landing pad for entrepreneurs from neighbouring countries and home to most of the startups operating in Indonesia. The journey strongly contributed to the USD 4 billion investment the Indonesia digital sector saw in 2017, drawing light to how the industry players in Jakarta have built themselves a strong tech ecosystem among generations of entrepreneurs, investors, media, and the government to support the nation’s startup landscape as enablers through the many secret local recipes to startup growth and sustainability.

Out of a population of 264 million, we have 66.5 per cent of youngsters of 15-65 and 54 per cent urban population that is the demographic that supports the growth of nation-wide digital transactions. Over 105 million of the total population are Internet users. It’s a huge market to address and tons of uniquely varying pain-points to aid – with still a big room to grow. Indonesia is also home to four out of ten Southeast Asian unicorns across all verticals, and our digital sector had an exponential 60-fold growth in the past 5 years - so we must be doing something right.

In “Insiders’ Guide to Jakarta Startups”, 32 of the most influential players in Indonesia’s tech ecosystem exclusively contributed their insights, first-hand experience and market-tested lessons - answering the most important questions of creating one’s own business.

The stories presented within provide technical advice and aims to inspire people along the lines of knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses, educating oneself, and keeping everything balanced in order to ensure a smooth ride during the venturesome journey.

Each of the founders shared their own journey from the founding of their startup, highlighting their experiences along the way.

The “Insiders’ Guide to Jakarta Startups” provides information on the co-working spaces, programmes, events and investors in Jakarta that the readers can consider as their approach strategy into the market. The guidebook is for anyone who wants to do something different in their lives; it’s for innovators, startup fans, creative thinkers, tech enthusiasts, and entrepreneurial minds seeking for advice and inspiration; it’s also for professionals who strive to start their own company; and for everyone trying to understand what it takes to set up a business in the Indonesian capital.

In Dila’s words:

Dilla Karinta want to provide a guide for entrepreneurs who are eager to step up the game in startup business.

I met Bettina Herz in 2016, when she arrived from Germany to work at one of the most active VCs in Indonesia, which I was already a part of. We were both there to manage several different projects separately; from community building, acceleration programmes, partnerships, investor relations, to media outreach. Sure enough it got us connected to many amazing thought leaders in the startup industry – be it seasoned venture builders, top corporate executives, and prominent investors.

Since we were living in the same building, it became kind of our habit to get together for dinner and we almost always got to exchanging inspiring stories about our long days at work where we usually had to opportunity to meet these various inspiring individuals on a daily basis.

On the other side, we were also exposed to hundreds of idea-stage and seed-stage startups that we knew had a lot of questions about growing their well-thought ideas the right way into a successful and sustainable business. Not to mention the foreign startups who were eager to learn about the Indonesian market and how its startup ecosystem works.

Therefore, my discussions with Bettina mostly ends with contemplating how we wish we could share the knowledge and mind-opening stories we had the pleasure to hear from the previous mentioned industry leaders to these aspiring entrepreneurs. Having the common knowledge that at least 80 per cent of startups die in their early-stage, we believe these motivated entrepreneurs could use all the information they can get from experienced players.

Their collective experience and the facts they shared gave us the idea to simply take notes whenever we met with these accomplished mentors, CEOs, and investors. Casual meetings became informational interviews. Then Bett and I developed what we thought was a good step-by-step set of chapters for ‘readers’ to understand the process of validating ideas and build them into a successful and sustainable business.

We were surprised to have all of these top-tier ecosystem insiders’ who were willing to open the doors for us and let us have a look behind the scenes of Indonesia’s thriving tech startup scene – and let us share their information in the form of a guidebook."

GO-VIET, the brand being introduced in Vietnam, will enter its beta testing phase in July, which will involve a select number of drivers and consumers, before it goes to full launch in the next few months. GET, the brand being introduced in Thailand, will launch soon afterwards following consultation with local stakeholders including government, drivers and consumers. Both companies will initially launch ride-hailing and on-demand logistics services before moving on to food delivery and payments.

The international expansion follows many months of planning by the company after its latest fundraising round, which saw backing from Astra International, Warburg Pincus, KKR, Meituan-Dianping, Tencent, Google and Temasek among others. USD$500 million of the funds raised were set aside for international expansion, as the company aims to increase its presence in Southeast Asia. GO-JEK is also planning new operations in Singapore and the Philippines.

GO-JEK CEO and Founder Nadiem Makarim, said:

“Our strategy is to combine the world-class technology developed by GO-JEK, with the in-depth market knowledge and expertise of the local teams, to create local businesses that really understand consumers. We believe that these in-country teams have the knowledge and experience to make the businesses in Vietnam and Thailand a huge success. They may be using different brands, but they will be operating under the same values system that has made GO-JEK the market leader in Indonesia. It’s not just about growth, it’s about finding ways to have a positive impact on as many people as possible. We have been working with them for several months now and are excited about continuing to do so as they launch their services and make their presence felt in their respective countries. Ultimately, we want to make sure consumers and drivers feel the benefit of a more competitive industry.”

Nguyen Vu Duc Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of GO-VIET said:

“GO-JEK is a pioneering technology company with an extensive ecosystem of 18 diverse services, backed by a strong group of strategic investors. The company’s support is ideal, not just because of its tech and operational know- how, but also because we share the same core values – the desire to make a positive impact on communities by improving living standards and income for families as well as bringing benefits for small- medium and micro businesses.”

The two companies described the investment as one piece of a broader partnership that will include the promotion of JD.com products on Google’s shopping service. This could help JD.com expand beyond its base in China and Southeast Asia and establish a meaningful presence in US and European markets.

Company officials said the agreement initially would not involve any major new Google initiatives in China, where the company’s main services are blocked over its refusal to censor search results in line with local laws.

JD.com’s investors include Chinese social media powerhouse Tencent Holdings, the arch-rival of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding, and Walmart. It also has a partnership with French retail giant Carrefour SA.

Google is stepping up its investments across Asia, where a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of infrastructure in retail, finance and other areas have made it a battleground for US and Chinese internet giants. Google recently took a stake in Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-jek, and sources have told Reuters that it may also invest in Indian e-commerce upstart Flipkart.

Google declined to comment on the rumoured Flipkart deal. The JD.com investment is being made by the operating unit of Google rather than one of parent company Alaphabet’s investment vehicles.

Google will get 27.1 million newly issued JD.com Class A ordinary shares as part of the deal. This will give them less than a 1 per cent stake in JD, a spokesman for JD said.

For JD.com, the Google deal shows its determination to build a set of global alliances as it seeks to counter Alibaba, which has been more focused on forging domestic retail tie-ups. Japan’s Softbank Group, which is making big internet investments around the globe, is a major investor in Alibaba.

“This partnership with Google opens up a broad range of possibilities to offer a superior retail experience to consumers throughout the world,” said Jianwen Liao, JD.com’s chief strategy officer, in a statement.

Company officials said the deal would marry Google’s market reach and strength in analytics with JD.com’s expertise in logistics and inventory management."

As Indonesian banks prepare for the implementation of the local IFRS 9 equivalent, Instrumen-Keuangan-PSAK-71 (PSAK 71), the Finastra software-as-a-service (SaaS) Regtech solution will help them prepare the necessary reports for compliance. Banks are able to send relevant information to the data center, hosted by Praweda Ciptakarsa Informatika (Praweda), who will classify the data, perform the necessary calculations and generate the relevant accounting metrics, balance sheets and reports, using Finastra’s Fusion Risk.

Imad Abou Haidar, Managing Director, Asia-Pacific at Finastra said, “Indonesia’s financial services sector sits amidst a fast-evolving regulatory landscape. With regulations to enhance governance and risk management activities continuing to evolve, the introduction of PSAK 71 is just the beginning of Indonesia’s compliance journey. Often, smaller and medium-sized banks leave preparation late, underestimating how many tentacles IFRS 9 has and how far they reach. Our successful track record of using Fusion Risk to help clients around the world to build an IFRS 9 risk-compliant framework stands us in good stead as we support customers in Indonesia with PSAK 71.”

“IFRS 9 implementation is a transformational event for financial institutions globally, and its associated reporting requirements create challenges not just for global franchises but also for regional and medium-sized banks,” said Rob Stubbs, Head of Research at Chartis, an independent research house that has done recent analysis of IFRS 9 and its related technology solutions. “We see significant variation in the level of preparedness across the industry, with some institutions fully prepared and others adopting short-term tactics or deploying last-minute fixes to meet the deadline. Efforts to address the requirements of IFRS 9 should not be underestimated.”

To enable banks in Indonesia to meet the deadline smoothly, Finastra has also teamed up with PT Abhimata Persada (PTAP) who will provide client support servicing and Neoflex Consulting (Neoflex) who will offer consultancy in recalibrating and building Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) models to help banks in Indonesia to stay compliant in a cost-effective and performance-efficient manner."

64 SHARES Share Tweet Share Email



The Ghana-based Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has seen it all since it launched in Africa in 2008, expanding across the continent and investing millions in tech startups.

To mark its 10th birthday, MEST, which recently launched a host of incubators in various African cities, held the MEST Africa Summit in Cape Town, bringing together the main players of the African tech scene to discuss its progress.

After a welcome talk by MEST founder and CEO Jorn Lyseggen, the conference got down to business with the United Nations of Tech panel, as representatives of various ecosystems across Africa convened to argue where the best places were to launch tech startups.

Lungisa Matshoba, chief technology officer (CTO) of South African fintech startup Yoco, said he believed Cape Town was the best place to launch a startup given the access to talent the city offered, but iROKO CEO Jason Njoku stole the show by claiming any startup – wherever it launched – would have to end up in Lagos given the size of its market.

Wherever an entrepreneur launches their business, there are positive developments to take note of. Panellists such as Aisha Pandor and GirlHype CEO Baratang Miya agreed there has never been a better time than now to launch a startup as a female founder, while speakers on the Impact Investing panel said investors were successfully marrying impact with returns when it comes to investing in startups in Africa.

Representatives of banks and startups espoused the merits of collaboration to foster financial inclusion, while the Creative Meets Tech panel discussed how tech is disrupting creative industries.

“Anyone with any kind of device can create any kind of content and distribute it,” said Catherine Lückhoff, CEO of Nichestreem.

“As a continent we are able to create content and tells stories that travels beyond continental borders. We used to keep content and not share it, and it is now being shared by the network effect, and artists are travelling

beyond their comfort zone and making money from it.”

In a fireside chat, Julien Decot, director of platform partnerships for EMEA at Facebook, discussed his company’s efforts to build communities on the continent.

“In order to serve all those people, there are a lot of building blocks. The first one was connectivity, so we started a very large-scale programme about four years ago and have connected tens of millions of people,” he said.

The second day kicked off with a panel based around agri-tech, in which Oswald Jumira, head of innovation partnerships at Liquid Telecom, said tech could help farmers access markets and manage their farms like never before.

“One thing African farmers need to learn a lot more is the outward side, because it has to be market-driven. I need to know who I am going to sell my produce to, I should know the price at which I’m going to sell it, and then I look backwards at how much inputs I need, how am I going to manage the logistics, the mechanisation,” he said.

Sunesh Bhoola, CEO at uLima, said it was vital to get the right balance between technologies and approaches to serve as many people as possible.

“It is a tough environment. We have a smartphone app, a USSD platform and a web page. So any farmer that is looking for information, we have made it available for them,” he said.

“You have to understand the market you are. Tech needs to be both inward and outward, depending where you are. Do the farmers need assistance managing their fields and crops? Then you go that way. But if it is an established farming country, the farmers know what they are doing, there’s masses of produce and they don’t know where it is going to go, then you start to look at the outward, and start connecting the buyers and sellers. It is market by market, each African country operating in a different way.”

Healthy debate among tech startups

Moving on to the blockchain panel, in which Wala CEO Tricia Martinez said zero-fee approaches were the best way of solving the financial inclusion problem.

“People focus on access, but there is a larger underbanked population who by choice don’t use banking. Access isn’t their issue. They are fed up with the inefficiencies of the global financial system, and they are avoiding fees,” she said.

Regulators must do more to assist blockchain companies.

“Most of the regulators have no idea about anything to do with this technology, and you can’t regulate something you don’t understand,” Martinez said.

Funding for startups was also a discussion point, with Polo Leteka, CEO of IDF Capital, calling for more female investors.

“It is important for us to see more women in this space, because investing tends to be an environment where you invest within the networks that you are accustomed to. Women tend to huddle together and the boys tend to huddle together, and invariably what that means is that the boys will primarily invest in male-owned businesses,” she said.

“It is important to profile women in this sector. I believe that profiling women gives other women permission to come into the sector and feel that they also belong in the space. So gender-lens investing is a very key theme of what we do. As a woman and as a leader in the industry I think it is important that we become more and more visible.”

Pule Taukobong, managing director of CRE Venture Capital, said African companies can solve global problems.

“We’ve seen Nigerian companies go to Indonesia, we’ve seen companies that make all their money overseas but are based in Africa. We can compete globally,” he said.

That is music to the ears of MEST, which has done so much to promote that idea, and attendees at the event, as the African tech space moves into a new stage of development.

Crowdfunding for Elections, How Much is Prabowo`s Wealth?

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - A few days ago, Gerindra Party Chairman Prabowo Subianto raised a crowdfunding for the Election of Regional Head and the Presidential Election. Because of this, many people said that Prabowo could be underfunded for the campaign, but Gerindra Party denied that, however, that also raises the question,: how much is Prabowo's total wealth actually is?

Prabowo reported his wealth last time on May 20, 2014, when running for president. In the report, the total assets reached Rp1.6 trillion and US$7.5 million more. The amount of his wealth makes him the richest candidate compared to other candidates at the time.

Prabowo's total wealth consists of immovable property in the form of land and buildings worth Rp105 billion. Moving assets in the form of vehicles reached Rp1.4 billion.

Moving assets in the form of agriculture, plantation, and mining reached Rp12 billion. In addition, he also has a collection of antique art goods worth Rp3 billion.

However, the biggest contributor to Prabowo's wealth is in the form of securities. He was recorded to have securities worth Rp1.5 trillion and US$7.5 million.

Meanwhile, assets in the form of demand deposits and other cash equivalents, namely Rp20 billion and US$3,000. The amount of his wealth must be reduced by a debt of only Rp28 million. With that, the amount of Prabowo's wealth at that time reached Rp1,670,392,580,402 and US$7,503,134.

Previously, Prabowo’s colleague, Kivlan Zen, had doubted about Prabowo's financial ability. According to the former Chief of Staff of the Army Strategic Reserves Command, the amount of Prabowo's property is still less than Gatot Nurmantyo, former Commander of the Indonesian National Army.

""Gatot dares to sell his assets, Prabowo does not, and now Prabowo does not dare to show up,"" Kivlan was quoted as saying by Tempo Magazine on April 22, 2018 edition.

Prabowo's decreasing financial issue was also mentioned by the West Java governor candidate Deddy Mizwar. Deddy had participated in the selection of candidates for governors in Gerindra Party. On one occasion, Deddy said, Prabowo told me that he no longer has the money to run as a presidential candidate.

Prabowo's brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, also admitted that logistics became one of his siblings' considerations to compete in 2019 presidential election. The criteria for the vice-presidential candidate that Prabowo will hold include the ability to provide financial resources.

""If the candidate has the access to logistics, thank God, Praise the Lord,"" Hashim said, on last March.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Following the crowdfunding path taken by Gerindra Chairman Prabowo Subianto to fund its party ahead of the 2019 presidential election (Pilpres), the party`s communication board member Andre Rosiade said that a high amount of funds is needed to face the democratic party in the country.

“The cost of participating in politics is getting expensive,” said Andre today, June 26.

Andre gave an example of the funds allocated for electoral voting ballot witnesses that would spend up to trillions of rupiah, on the other hand, the party’s logistical ability is currently limited. He revealed that Gerindra had relied on its members for its main funding, however, it could only manage to provide 20 percent of the party’s total needs.

The crowdfunding system that Gerindra Chairman Prabowo Subianto chose to take is being done through the Telegram app, where people can donate to the party’s official Telegram account, @GalangPerjuangan.

Thus, how many donations has Gerindra collected since it was opened on June 23? According to Andre, the donations collected reached Rp296 million. “That’s roughly the total amount we gathered,” he said.

Furthermore, Andre maintained that the crowdfunding scheme heavily promoted by Prabowo Subianto has been considered as a normal practice in politics abroad. Other than to maintain transparency of the party’s operational costs, he said that it also acts as a way to reassure the credibility of Gerindra politicians and distance themselves from capitalists.

The system will offer doctors a diagnosis and suggested treatment within seconds and is likely to be approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) next year, according to Ni.

The analysis will be based on case studies of about 280,000 previous lung cancer cases, said Ni, adding that “simply pooling” cross-disciplinary data without using AI for analysis will not provide the necessary platform for assisting in medical decisions. Every year about 830,000 people in China are diagnosed with lung cancer, with the disease accounting for one quarter of all cancer deaths in the country.

Shanghai-based Yitu is one of dozens of AI startup that have emerged in China over the past two years to form the basis of a new industry dubbed the fourth industrial revolution. In its core area of facial recognition, Yitu claims its AI systems can identify an individual from the 1.4 billion faces stored in China’s national databases in just three seconds.

“The five-year survival rate for lung cancer … below 20% … has shown no clear improvement over the past two decades,” said Li Weimin, director of West China hospital. “To improve the survival rate has been difficult.”

While the initial focus is on lung cancer, the hospital has agreed to work with Yitu on jointly developing AI applications for 10 types of cancers, including gastric, colon, liver and breast cancer, according to Li.

Founded in 2012, Yitu completed a US$200mil (RM801.60mil) round of funding earlier this month, with investors including ICBC International, Gaocheng Venture Capital, and SPDB International. China accounted for 48% of the total US$15.2bil (RM60.92bil) raised by AI companies worldwide last year, outstripping the 38% raised by US firms, according to US research firm CB Insights.

“The future of AI is in health care,” said Fang Cong, vice-president of Yitu. “Its application has grown from diagnosis of a single disease to multiple ones, and from natural language processing or computer vision to comprehensive analysis.”

Still, the lung cancer initiative comes after IBM’s Watson health care unit in the US, one of the industry’s pioneers in AI-enabled medical query services, laid off more than 50% of its staff last month, according to a report by the Register.

Ni said he was not surprised by the lay offs. “Watson is not integrated into hospitals. Doctors have to print out a patient’s record, and sometimes manually fill in as many as 200 characteristics or symptoms,” he said. “Focused on treatment instead of diagnosis, [Watson] can only give a rough therapy guideline.”

China is already ahead of the US when it comes to AI enabled diagnosis, according to Ni. “AI is seen as the best solution for China, where health care problems are more severe than in the US, which has a narrower gap in skill levels among doctors,” he said.

“China has a huge population base, with strong demand for a solution to the shortage of doctors at different levels of hospitals,” said Ni, adding that the “human cost” also works in China’s favour because US doctors cost between US$250,000 (RM1mil) and US$300,000 (RM1.20mil) per year, two to three times more than a programmer is paid and far more than AI startups can afford.

Yitu has a team of about 400 doctors, most of whom work part-time for about 10 hours a week to help label data, while one fifth of its full-time employees have a medical background.

Having set up its first international office in Singapore earlier this year, the startup is looking to expand into South-East Asia including Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, Ni said. — South China Morning Post"

Alphabet Inc.’s Google will buy newly issued Class A shares at $20.29 per share, equivalent to $40.58 per ADS, the companies said in a joint statement Monday. The pair plan to explore joint development of retail solutions in regions, including Southeast Asia, the U.S. and Europe. The deal comes just a week after Google struck an alliance with Carrefour SA to sell groceries online in France through the U.S. company’s platforms including Home and Assistant.

The flurry of activity signals Google’s growing ambitions in e-commerce. The French partnership will allow consumers to order staples through Google services on their smartphones, tablets or other devices. The latest deal is aimed at combining JD’s expertise in logistics and supply chain with Google’s technology to experiment with changes in how people shop.

Google shares were little changed at $1,163.56 in New York at 10:19 a.m.. The American depository receipts of JD.com rose 2.4 percent to $44.63.

“We are excited to partner with JD.com and explore new solutions for retail ecosystems around the world to enable helpful, personalized and frictionless shopping experiences that give consumers the power to shop wherever and however they want,” Philipp Schindler, Google chief business officer, said in the statement.

One of the draws for Google is that JD.com has its own fulfillment and logistics network, similar to Amazon.com, said Bloomberg intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral. JD.com offers Google a more scalable infrastructure than that of other China-based e-commerce monoliths such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which focus more on listings.

Retail is the biggest advertising area for Google, and the search giant’s spending on e-commerce is likely to increase, Waral said. The partnership with JD.com represents Google’s push to develop a long-term defense strategy against Amazon’s ad-market with two main goals: to retain their strength in retail advertising, and to expand into a bigger addressable market.

“It’s an offensive and defensive play,” Waral said.

The partnership with JD.com will likely serve as a benchmark for other retailers fighting against Amazon, as it will make it easier for Google to sell ad and cloud services and AI tools down the line, Waral said.

Google and JD have already teamed up elsewhere. They both participated in the latest funding round of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, a challenger in the ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia.

JD, which competes with giant Alibaba Group Holding, came under fire last month by a hedge-fund manager, who called China’s No. 2 e-commerce operator overvalued and criticized its “silly” investments. Kok Hoi Wong, chief investment officer for APS Asset Management, said his own internal valuation for the $63 billion company was “a tiny figure.”"

(Reuters)

Google will invest $550 million in Chinese e-commerce powerhouse JD.com, part of the U.S. internet giant’s efforts to expand its presence in fast-growing Asian markets and battle rivals including Amazon.com. The two companies described the investment as one piece of a broader partership that will include the promotion of JD.com products on Google’s shopping service. This could help JD.com expand beyond its base in China and Southeast Asia and establish a meaningful presence in U.S. and European markets. Company officials said the agreement initially would not involve any major new Google initiatives in China, where the company’s main services are blocked over its refusal to censor search results in line with local laws.

JD.com’s investors include Chinese social media powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd, the arch-rival of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and Walmart Inc. It also has a partnership with French retail giant Carrefour SA. Google is stepping up its investments across Asia, where a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of infrastucture in retail, finance and other areas have made it a battleground for U.S. and Chinese internet giants. Google recently took a stake in Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek, and sources have told Reuters that it may also invest in Indian e-commerce upstart Flipkart.

Google declined to comment on the rumoured Flipkart deal. The JD.com investment is being made by the operating unit of Google rather than one of parent company Alaphabet’s investment vehicles. Google will get 27.1 million newly issued JD.com Class A ordinary shares as part of the deal. This will give them less than a 1 percent stake in JD, a spokesman for JD said.

For JD.com, the Google deal shows its determination to build a set of global alliances as it seeks to counter Alibaba, which has been more focused on forging domestic retail tie-ups. Japan’s Softbank Group Corp, which is making big internet investments around the globe, is a major investor in Alibaba. “This partnership with Google opens up a broad range of possibilities to offer a superior retail experience to consumers throughout the world,” said Jianwen Liao, JD.com’s chief strategy officer, in a statement. Company officials said the deal would marry Google’s market reach and strength in analytics with JD.com’s expertise in logistics and inventory management."

This could help JD.com expand beyond its base in China and Southeast Asia and establish a meaningful presence in U.S. and European markets.

JD.com’s U.S.-listed shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $43.76 on Nasdaq.

Company officials said the agreement initially would not involve any major new Google initiatives in China, where the company’s main services are blocked over its refusal to censor search results in line with local laws.

JD.com’s investors include Chinese social media powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd, the arch-rival of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and Walmart Inc.

The partnership not only lets Google bolster its retail ambitions in China but also allows it to further tighten its relationship with Walmart. Together, the two companies could challenge the dominance of Amazon and Alibaba in key markets around the world, analysts said.

In the past year, Google has partnered with Walmart on multiple fronts. In August 2017, the two companies joined forces to offer hundreds of thousands of Walmart items on Google's voice-controlled Google Assistant platform to counter the dominance of Amazon in the voice shopping market. (goo.gl/fsZk2g)

In March, Reuters reported a new program where Google was teaming up with retailers like Walmart, allowing them to list their products on Google Search, as well as on the Google Express shopping service to better compete with Amazon.

STEPPING UP INVESTMENTS IN ASIA

Google is stepping up its investments across Asia, where a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of infrastructure in retail, finance and other areas have made it a battleground for U.S. and Chinese internet heavyweights. Google recently took a stake in Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek.

The JD.com investment is being made by the operating unit of Google rather than one of parent company Alphabet’s investment vehicles.

Google will get 27.1 million newly issued JD.com Class A ordinary shares as part of the deal. This will give them less than a 1 percent stake in JD, a spokesman for JD said.

Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, which is making big internet investments around the globe, is a major investor in Alibaba.

Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam said the investment will help JD.com expand into developed markets such as the United States and Europe, where it has lesser exposure compared to Google.

Retail is the biggest advertising area for Google, and the search giant's spending on e-commerce is likely to increase, Waral said. The partnership with JD.com represents Google's push to develop a long-term defense strategy against Amazon's ad-market with two main goals: to retain their strength in retail advertising, and to expand into a bigger addressable market.

""It's an offensive and defensive play,"" Waral said.

The partnership with JD.com will likely serve as a benchmark for other retailers fighting against Amazon, as it will make it easier for Google to sell ad and cloud services and AI tools down the line, Waral said.

Google and JD have already teamed up elsewhere. They both participated in the latest funding round of Indonesia's Go-Jek, a challenger in the ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia.

JD, which competes with giant Alibaba Group Holding, came under fire last month by a hedge-fund manager, who called China's No. 2 e-commerce operator overvalued and criticized its ""silly"" investments. Kok Hoi Wong, chief investment officer for APS Asset Management, said his own internal valuation for the $63 billion company was ""a tiny figure."""

Google's purchase of 27.1m shares in JD.com, bought at $20.29 per share, equates to less than 1% stake.

The two companies plan to collaborate on a set of strategic initiatives including the combination of JD’s supply chain and logistics background with Google’s tech to develop retail solutions in south east Asia, Europe and the US.

Aside from Google entering the Chinese e-commerce market where its main products of its search engine, maps, Gmail and YouTube remain banned, the move will also benefit JD which could use Google’s parent company Alphabet to enter European markets.

""This partnership with Google opens up a broad range of possibilities to offer a superior retail experience to consumers throughout the world,"" JD's chief strategy officer, Jianwen Liao, said in a statement Monday.

The pair say they plan to explore joint development of retail solutions in regions, including Southeast Asia, the U.S. and Europe. The deal comes just a week after Google struck an alliance with Carrefour to sell groceries online in France through the U.S. company's platforms including Home and Assistant.

The flurry of activity signals Google's growing ambitions in e-commerce. The French partnership will allow consumers to order staples through Google services on their smartphones, tablets or other devices. The latest deal is aimed at combining JD's expertise in logistics and supply chain with Google's technology to experiment with changes in how people shop.

210;765278214;20180618;2018;http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2151282/jdcom-hastens-e-commerce-race-southeast-asia-us550-million-stake-sale-google;"Chinese online retailer JD.com has signed on Google as a strategic partner in a move seen to complement the former’s ambitions to expand into Southeast Asia while giving the latter a toehold in a market that it gave up in 2010.

Under the arrangement, JD.com will sell a less than 1 per cent stake to Google for US$550 million. JD.com will also join Google Shopping, an advertising platform for online merchants, where its products will be available to consumers globally.

Google’s investment in JD.com comes as e-commerce companies, including Alibaba Group and Amazon, race to expand their global reach and carve a larger slice of market share in regions such as Southeast Asia, where the potential for e-commerce is viewed as largely untapped.

Chinese smartphones brands such as Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi have proven to be a hit among consumers in the region of 650 million people with their affordably priced models. Tencent Holdings, the online gaming and social media giant, is the largest shareholder in Singapore-based Sea, which operates Shopee, a regional e-commerce platform. Other internet services companies such as Didi Chuxing and Meituan Dianping have invested in local champions such as Singapore-based Grab and Jakarta-based Go-jek, respectively.

China's future couriers: Robots, drones and self-driving trucks

Alibaba bought Singapore-based e-commerce platform Lazada and appointed one of its co-founders and most senior executives, Lucy Peng, to head the push into Southeast Asia. Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.





JD.com, too, has its eyes on Thailand, with a new online shopping platform developed with Thailand’s Central Group slated to open on June 18. In Vietnam, JD.com invested in local e-commerce firm Tiki.vn earlier this year. In Indonesia, JD.com launched a local online retail business JD.ID two years ago.



“Logistics and language sites, everything should be localised here,” Winston Cheng, JD.com’s president of international business said in an interview in Singapore last week before the Google tie-up.

“Today, people have higher and higher demand,” he said. “They want anything anytime anywhere but right away so the cross-border business model takes too long to wait for.”

JD.com achieved 159.2 billion yuan (US$24.7 billion) in orders from June 1 to June 18, generating annual growth of 37 per cent for the company’s 618 Mid-Year Shopping Festival, an online shopping event similar to Alibaba’s Singles’ Day Shopping event on November 11.

JD.com has also deepened cooperation with its biggest shareholder Tencent, launching a new shopping function on WeChat before the 618 Shopping Festival. The function enables consumers to shop on JD.com within WeChat, China’s biggest social network and messaging app. Product pages from JD.com pop up when consumers type product-related keywords into the search functions on WeChat.

JD the latest Chinese firm to bring unmanned trucks to highways



Google, together with other US internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter, are blocked in China, although several firms still maintain offices in the country selling advertisements to Chinese firms hoping to reach an overseas audience. Other companies, like Apple, continue to sell their products and services in China after complying with local rules, such as hosting its cloud services for the Chinese market on the mainland.

“Google’s strategy for investing in JD.com is two-pronged. On one hand, it hopes to have a significant partner in China to support the company, which could help it reintroduce services like cloud or advertisements in China,” said James Yan, research director at Counterpoint. “Secondly, JD.com is strong in areas like logistics, courier delivery and so forth, which Google can tap on to expand its e-commerce ambitions.”

The partnership is complementary as JD.com is in the business of e-commerce and logistics and is unlikely to clash with Google’s other services, such as cloud or OS services, Yan said.

Alibaba promotes technology as long term solution to poverty

“We want to accelerate how retail ecosystems deliver consumer experiences that are helpful, personalized and offer high quality service in a range of countries around the world, including in Southeast Asia,” Karim Temsamani, president of Google’s Asia Pacific operations, said in a statement.

The Asia-Pacific region is one of the largest and fastest growing e-commerce marketplaces in the world, with people in Southeast Asia alone expected to spend US$88.1 billion online by 2025, according to Temsamani.

“This partnership with Google opens up a broad range of possibilities to offer a superior retail experience to consumers throughout the world,” Jianwen Liao, JD.com’s chief strategy officer, said in a statement. “This marks an important step in the process of modernising global retail.”

Southeast Asia consists of 11 countries with a total population of 653.4 million, about 49 per cent of whom live in urban areas, according to the latest United Nations estimates. Only three per cent of the region’s retail sales are currently conducted online.

Among the biggest barriers to developing a regional Southeast Asian market is the lack of mobile payments, with about 70 per cent of the region’s population still unbanked. The thousands of islands that make up the archipelagic nation of Indonesia also presents logistics challenges.

JD.com will adopt different strategies to cater to the differences of the region, according to a spokesman. While there is no one-size-fits-all model given the different infrastructure, languages, cultures and religions across the region, e-commerce is still booming because of the commonality of a rising middle class, the spokesman said.

“Alibaba sees Southeast Asia as a priority region within our global strategy,” an Alibaba spokesperson said in comments made before the JD.com-Google partnership announcement. “We are also committed to contributing to the growth of the digital ecosystem in Southeast Asia by driving initiatives to develop an e-commerce talent pool.”"

It is not hard to love online shopping: it’s quick, convenient and infinitely more peaceful than braving a crowded mall. Indeed, online shoppers worldwide spent US$15trn in 2017, and that figure is set to grow further in 2018, according to the Hootsuite’s Digital in 2018 Trends report released earlier this year.

But online shopping is not always as seamless as it could be. Today, shopping inspiration has moved from runways and glossy magazine spreads to social media and influencers, but the shopping experience still needs to catch up. Research from Mintel found that in the US, for instance, social media ranks as the number one influencer of fashion shopping amongst women 18-24, and nearly 32% of women aged 18-34 are open to buying clothing directly from a social media platform.

Given consumers’ vociferous appetite for social media in Asia Pacific, it’s no surprise that there’s a similar shift in ecommerce happening in the region, too. Our research shows there are 1.77bn active users on social media across Asia, and 1.71bn of them are using mobile devices to connect, browse and discover. Last year the region represented six of the 15 top ecommerce spenders including Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia and China

However, until recently, shopping on social media typically meant being redirected to a traditional e-commerce website, making what should be a straightforward online retail experience a complex one.

From the amount of money spent online – and time spent on social – it’s clear that shoppers are seeking more convenience-based offerings, and retailers must meet this demand by developing a smoother online shopping experience that is simple and secure.

To be sure, ads are already the new standard on major global social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. But how do businesses use social media to not only grow brand awareness, but drive real business results?

Shoppable ads

The rise of shoppable ads – which have been popularised by Youtube and Facebook – has been swift. By removing the amount of clicks needed for customers to purchase a product, shoppable ads have streamlined the online shopping process, which means that customers are more likely to complete a purchase. Today, the major trend in shoppable ads, which are being introduced on highly visual platforms like Instagram, is for brands to partner with relevant social media influencers. According to Edelman’s 2017 Trust Barometer, 85% of the public does not trust public institutions and instead are turning to peers – which includes bloggers, vloggers, and other relatable online personalities – for recommendations and advice. This type of partnership could likely create a boon for brands since influencers are already a trusted source for customers and provide an extra layer of engagement.

Ad Personalisation

The ability to precisely reach the right audience used to be something marketers dreamed of. But with digital and social, that dream is now a reality. Audience targeting is one of the most enticing advertising tools social media offers, as it allows businesses to tailor their ads specifically for their target demographic, which helps them spend their money more efficiently and generate more sales. What’s more, consumers actually like personalised ads, as evidenced by an Adlucent study, which found 71% of consumers prefer them because they decrease the amount of irrelevant ads, helping them discover new products and make shopping easier. So use targeting tools responsibly in order to promote your business and reach new customers.

Social payments

For consumers, the most practical innovation being adopted by ecommerce sites is social payment options through trusted, secure digital wallets like Alipay, Apple Pay, and PayPal. These allow customers to easily purchase a product without the hassle of manually typing in credit card information, and reassures customers that the ecommerce sites is not fraudulent – a belief about online shopping that’s still widespread in some Southeast Asian nations, particularly in Indonesia, that can be a major barrier to online retailers. By accepting these types of payments, ecommerce becomes a truly trusted, frictionless shopping experience.

Everyone can agree that a pleasant customer service experience that doesn’t require hours of waiting on the phone for a representative is the dream. With chatbots, that dream can become a reality, especially for customer service needs that arise outside of normal working hours. Available 24/7, these AI customer service reps are able to introduce products and boost brand messaging as well as answer customer questions and offer solutions, providing a quick solution for brands looking to improve or revamp their simple customer service interactions online. If an issue is too complex for a chatbot is to solve, though, don’t fret: that’s where your customer service representatives step in.

Providing a simple, efficient shopping experience is completely achievable for brands of all sizes and can be quickly implemented into social media thanks to the myriad tools that are already built into social media platforms. By launching this type of ecommerce, your customers will appreciate the ease of the shopping experience, which will boost their loyalty and, in turn, provide you with more qualified leads and sales.

216;762337889;20180607;2018;http://businessweekme.com/fighting-the-fintech-giants-in-asia/;"Piyush Gupta runs Southeast Asia’s largest bank and most valuable public company, Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings Ltd. It has thrived by lending to regional companies and managing the wealth of Asia’s new rich. So why does the chief executive officer sound at times like a banker under siege? Gupta sees trouble ahead—not from DBS’s rivals in banking but from financial-­technology companies in China.

Banks everywhere have to deal with ­fintech upstarts, but it’s different in Asia. “We are in the front line,” Gupta says. In the U.S., tech giants such as Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook, and Google have been slow to move into online finance, where they would face far tighter and more complex regulation than they’re used to. So U.S. banks “could afford to be a little more sanguine,” Gupta says.

Contrast that with how Chinese fintech companies are transforming the way their customers save and spend. Ant Financial, owned by billionaire Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., oversees the world’s biggest money-­market fund, with $270 billion in assets. The company handles more than $2.4 trillion in mobile payments every three months. Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the company behind the messaging system WeChat, control more than 90 percent of the online payments business in China. And they’re expanding rapidly into DBS’s territory.

DBS is trying to stave off the fintech threat by getting there first. From 2012 through 2016 it invested about $3.5 billion upgrading its technology, including the development of its mobile payments app, DBS PayLah!, which has about 800,000 users in Singapore. It recruited some 1,000 part-­timers to go around to the country’s famous hawker ­centers, where cooks in stalls sell inexpensive street food, persuading them to shun cash and go digital. As customers use less cash, the number of DBS branches in Singapore could drop about 10 percent over the next five years, Gupta says.

In overseas markets such as Indonesia, instead of buying banks, DBS is trying to expand its retail business in the same way Ant and Tencent did—by rolling out digital payment services. “Our role model is a tech company,” Gupta says. “Because they are not burdened with a legacy, they basically came and reimagined how banking could be done.”

The competition is moving quickly into the same markets DBS is vying for. Ant has partnered with companies in Thailand and Indonesia to provide payments services. Tencent has invested in Go-Jek, an Indonesian ride-­hailing company that also has a payments app. Local players in Singapore are fighting for new users, too. Grab, a ride-hailing company with 4 million users, launched an e-wallet last year.

Upstarts can begin with simple transactions—for example, paying for rides—and work their way up to broader financial services. DBS is trying to build on the banking relationships it already has. In May it launched a digital financial adviser available in Singapore. It analyzes bank account activity, categorizes expenses, and offers advice based on a user’s budget and financial goals. “It is a sensible product in the sense that banks would be well placed to integrate themselves into ­customers’ daily lives beyond banking,” says Kevin Kwek, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Gupta took over at DBS in 2009 after rising through the ranks at Citigroup Inc. “Piyush was an early proponent of using technology to serve more customers more efficiently,” says Vikram Pandit, a former Citigroup CEO who was Gupta’s boss. Gupta also dabbled briefly but unsuccessfully in the startup world. He quit Citigroup in 2001 to found an internet portal in India around the time the dot-com bubble was bursting.

DBS’s digital push has helped lower the bank’s costs and boost its return on equity. Last year, 80 percent of new small and midsize corporate clients in Singapore, and 37 percent of incoming wealth-management customers, started their relationship digitally, DBS said in its 2017 annual report. Gupta is the first to admit that all his preparations may not be enough to outmaneuver fintech challengers. Leaders of some companies, he says, might quote Mike Tyson, who said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. “But you don’t know where the punch in the face is going to come from,” Gupta says.

Hong Kong-based logistics startup Lalamove has been accelerating its expansion in Indonesia following the set up of its company in the market in February. Lalamove aims to give a different logistical approach from similar, existing companies.

Lalamove Indonesia Marketing Manager David Ceasario explained that the company’s business model offers last-mile delivery services for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to reach out to their customers. The service offers same-day delivery service with a two-hour maximum distance for one location, and an extra 30 minute for additional location. For the time being, the service only offers motorbike as a mode of transportation.

“Before we start operating, we had already done a market research for a year to make sure that what we provide is in line with what the market needs. For the time being we only offer motorbikes as a mode of transportation, considering the density of Jakarta as a city,” Ceasario told DailySocial on Tuesday.

The company is targeting motorbike riders to help them make extra income. The requirements are quite simple: They only have to provide data according to their driver’s licence, citizen ID card, et cetera. The vehicle’s age should not be older than 10 years since its production.

Driver-partners will then be required to attend a full-day training before they can officially be part of Lalamove. The goal of the training is so that they can understand the company’s logistical SOP.

“[Running a] B2B service requires certainty and stability. We need to train the drivers so that they can be fully aware of it, with the goal that they can be responsible in doing their job,” Ceasario said.

Lalamove also paid extra attention to their customer service (CS) team, as the team will be directly in contact with customers when problems arise. This is why Lalamove decides to set up its own CS team instead of working with a third party.

“Our CS officers are also trained to be a pro-active problem-solver, to always ask for feedback from customers and partners, what needs to be improved, et cetera. Since we are working in B2B sector, trust is a very important element, that’s why they have to be trained,” Ceasario said.

Lalamove features development

lalamove_launch_indonesia_2 More

Lalamove offers two types of mobile apps with different functions. The first one was dedicated to driver-partner while the other one is for Lalamove users, both individuals and SMEs. The UI/UX was designed to be as simple as possible and to-the-point.

The landing page displayed options for goods delivery. Users only have to put pick-up location and destination. The app will then calculate the shipping fee that has to be paid, with other additional charges for purchase service or round trip.

Purchase service is a shopping service for end users that allows drivers to buy food and other goods for a maximum of IDR300,000 (US$21.6) per transaction.

“In other countries, Lalamove already have different kinds of unique logistics services. In Hong Kong we have a logistic service to pick-up pets, while in the Philippines we have a medicine delivery service,” Ceasario said.

Business owners are able to put a driver into their favourite list so that the driver will be prioritised every time the company placed an order. Users can also use the multi-drop feature for delivery to up to 10 destinations for each booking.

Ceasario said that the company will continue on developing new features to adjust to the market’s needs. There is a possibility that they are going to implement features that have already been launched in other markets.

Interviewer: Welcome Salman, thank you for being here with us today. You’ve been bang in the middle of Pakistani telecom most of your career, you’re a mentor at LUMS, Jazz NIC, other incubators… You’ve had a vantage point from where you’ve closely witnessed the birth of the mobile internet and we’re excited to hear your thoughts on where things are going.

Salman Wassay: It’s a pleasure to be here. Absolutely, as you mentioned, mobile internet really has changed things in a big way here in our country. Telecom was how people connected, now its apps. Internet-enabled apps for communication, for services, for buying/ selling/ sending/ receiving. The Shared Economy is making the day to day needs more accessible. It’s a great time to be here. We’re seeing the people of Pakistan become tech savvy at a phenomenal rate which will change many things about our way of life in the next 10 years.

Interviewer: So, Salman for people who don’t know, what is the Shared Economy?

Salman Wassay: Well the Social Sharing Economy offers immense value, especially in underdeveloped nations if used correctly. At its core, the “Shared Economy” is literally just the sharing of resources between people. Derived from not-for-profit initiatives, the on-demand economy has quickly appeared on the global business landscape and has evolved into a collection of firms that connect millions of consumers with other private citizens for goods and services on-demand. With mobile apps, the uptake has been unprecedented.

Interviewer: So, in your opinion, where does Pakistan stand in this regard right now and how do you see the Shared Economy further impacting our future?

Salman Wassay: Well, as most of Pakistan is already experiencing first-hand, Uber and Careem are sending ripples through the country with their ride-sharing service. The service as you know, lets you catch a ride in most major cities of Pakistan. We haven’t seen many other services using the shared economy method picking up the way the major players have, which is a concern for me. I believe the mindset is currently being changed and with time more services will appear on the landscape. We’ll probably see Airbnb become more commonplace in Pakistan, and hopefully something like TaskRabbit. With these services growing I’m keen to see the positive impact on customer services in our country.

Interviewer: If I’m not mistaken, you see the Shared Economy model being implemented right now as mostly self-styled right?

Salman Wassay: Well right now the major players are focused on uptake. Shared Economy implementation in Pakistan currently involves, to a large extent, taking on investors who buy a great deal of vehicles and run them on the service. This isn’t necessarily helping build community but once the Pakistani people have become more used to these kinds of services we’ll probably see more “people” using the shared economy to “help” one another.

Interviewer: Why start a delivery service and where does Couch Potato stand right now?

Salman Wassay: We started Couch Potato with the belief that people should do more meaningful things with their time. For people who would rather not run menial errands after work. For those who want to spend time with family instead of rushing to pick up the eggs. For when you forgot something at a friend’s house or the office. Couch Potato works to free up time in these situations and more.

Being headquartered in Islamabad, we’ve done over 75,000 deliveries in Karachi and Islamabad since inception. Our deliveries have included food delivery, package deliveries like laptop chargers or documents, shopping locally, shopping from other cities, and some fun deliveries like birthday balloons and presents.

We partner with young people with motorbikes, enabling them to use their extra hours to do some extra work and earn. Riders we team up with are part of a trusted community and take regular trainings in-house. We’re happy to be contributing in our own way towards improving lives with our service.

Interviewer: Are Careem and Uber your competitors?

Salman Wassay: I wouldn’t say Careem or Uber are our direct competitors, but we do share a very similar model and appeal to a similar audience. Although Careem has recently moved into the delivery domain through bikes in Pakistan, we’re not worried. There is enough to go around with the industry constantly growing and going through changes every day; regulatory and otherwise.

Let me throw in some facts. Over the past five years, developments in the e-commerce and online retailing space have driven noticeable growth in the Delivery Services industry. Pakistan is poised to hit $1 Billion in ecommerce revenue by the end of 2018. Originally the forecasts were to hit a billion by 2020. Which means deliveries, lots and lots of deliveries. E-commerce cannot grow without the growth in last mile delivery, and that’s where companies like couch potato come in. There are also currently 40+ million smartphones in Pakistan and the numbers are growing at a phenomenal rate. This momentum is expected to continue with a now digitally connected consumer, looking for lower prices, greater convenience and a seamless experience when buying and receiving products.

There’s bound to be giants, doing a lot of things, but services like ours, focused on just deliveries, will have an edge of their own.

Interviewer: So, is Careem venturing in the same business as Couch Potato?

Salman Wassay: As I mentioned earlier, the word is they are moving into the delivery service space, but I can’t be certain. The only thing my team and I are focused on is bringing the absolute best last mile delivery experience to the people of Pakistan.

Interviewer: What is in the future for Couch Potato?

Salman Wassay: Well, Pakistan is one of the world’s largest youth bulge countries with 56 percent population (age 15-64) in the productive age group. We will continue to enable communities with a line of products and affiliations that will link in with Couch Potato. Some of our goals are:

Building trust in a country that struggles with trust

Offering flexibility to service providers in deciding their typical working hours

Linking consumers seamlessly with everyday items within their city

A seamless tool to manage their day to day delivery related errands

Several local and international parties have shown interest in collaborating, investing, and potentially buying Couch Potato. We are speaking to a few large Logistics Service Providers, to see how we can take this brand and delivery service all over Pakistan and the rest of the world.

Interviewer: Thank you for being with us today Salman. Very insightful. Any final words?

Salman Wassay: Every day we discover a new type of delivery-related function for Couch Potato when we see how our customers are using it. The data we are accumulating is priceless and Couch Potato is evolving into what could be the Go-JEK of retail and package delivery in Pakistan. If GO-JEK; an Indonesian hyperlocal transport, logistics and payments startup founded in 2010, can do 350,000+ bookings a day on average (January 2016), we are a similar market, why can’t we be in the same range?

I’m very much looking forward to where the industry is going because technology is allowing us to imagine things which we couldn’t before. I see Pakistan as an over one billion USD hyper-local delivery and e-commerce delivery industry in the next 5-10 years. I see good things for our future."

When Skift put together its list of the year’s top 20 travel startups, we wanted to ignore the ones hyped elsewhere.

We also only included startups that have raised less than $25 million in venture funding. The reason? We’ve reviewed hundreds of emerging travel companies over nearly six years, and we’ve found that fundraising is a separate skill from building solid companies. Here’s our all-star list, presented in alphabetical order.

20 Startups to Watch in 2018

Betterez Bus companies get the modern reservations and ticketing tools they need Money Raised: Undisclosed

Headline Investors: Amadeus Ventures and JetBlue Technology Ventures Skift Take: This company has taken seven years to crack the complicated technical problem of building a set of tools that can help ground transportation providers shift up a gear and run their businesses more efficiently. It appears to have built a product that can scale up, at last — just in time for a sector in desperate need of a tech upgrade. Think: bus-side mobile ticket scanning, accurate ridership reports, optimized pricing for demand, and mobile shopping and upselling.

Bidroom An Amazon Prime for hotel bookings Money Raised: Undisclosed

Headline Investors: Egyptian multi-millionaire Samih Sawiris Skift Take: Booking Holdings and Expedia Group are squeezing independent hotels with commissions and costs that can total as much as 30 percent. Many owners are eager for alternatives. Bidroom aims to offer one, charging hotels zero commissions after a one-time $174, or €149, fee. It charges travelers $69, or €59, a year for access. Recent changes in contracts between the online travel giants and hotels allow each side to offer discounted rates via membership-based platforms. Credit card issuer Visa is marketing Bidroom to its users in Europe.

Destygo Chatbots for travel Money Raised: $1.3 million (€1 million)

Headline Investors: Partech Ventures, with AccorHotels in a small stake Skift Take: Building a chatbot isn’t the same thing as building a business. Destygo stands apart from other chatbot builders by creating a conversational artificial intelligence platform specialized for the travel industry. Only a year old — and a graduate of International Airlines Group (IAG)’s Hangar 51 accelerator — the company already builds chat- and voice-assistants for companies, such as travel management company Carlson Wagonlit Travel and Iberia Airlines.

Evolve Uber-izing vacation rental property management Money Raised: $23 million

Headline Investors: PAR Capital and T. Rowe Price Skift Take: Yes, many well-funded companies like Vacasa are wringing efficiencies out of the vacation rental sector with new tech and new business models. But the market is large and fragmented, with room for fresh models. Evolve stands out by offering owners services a la carte. Its basic set comes with only a 10 percent commission, while some rivals require a larger package of services and charge commissions of up to 30 percent. Evolve has signed up owners or managers of 7,500 active units of inventory, which it expects to double within a year.

Fornova Helping hotels preserve rate integrity Money Raised: $20.1 million

Headline Investors: Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Waypoint, and JAL Ventures Skift Take: Fornova got its start, essentially, as the world’s most sophisticated web scraper. It helped customers like Priceline and Expedia trawl online rates for hotels and compare how often hotels and other websites were undercutting them on price. The startup has since expanded with an array of technologies that help hotels maintain the integrity of their rates. So far, Marriott, Accor, and other hotel groups use Fornova to monitor and benchmark online rates and automatically react to ensure they sell every room in the smartest way.

Futurestay A genuinely end-to-end management platform for vacation rental owners Money Raised: $2.8 million

Headline Investors: Newark Venture Partners Skift Take: Managers of vacation rental properties want to market their properties on Airbnb, Booking.com, and other platforms, and many companies have popped up to sell software to help. But almost none of these online tools are comprehensive in automating the tasks required after a traveler has clicked a “book now” button, such as handling any refund issues that might crop up. Futurestay strives to handle it all, leaving owners with less manual work. CEO Philip Kennard said it serves more than 100,000 properties, despite having spent nothing on search engine marketing or ads of any kind.

Hotelogix Letting hotels ditch their servers Money Raised: $8 million

Headline Investors: Accel, Saama, and Vertex Skift Take: Most hotel groups in India and emerging markets run server-based management systems at their properties and lack centralized control at the corporate level. The hoteliers also have little ability to transact with online travel agencies in real-time. Hotelogix stitches all of this together with mobile-first, internet-based software for customers in 100 countries. Other startups, such as Mews and SiteMinder, have products with overlapping functions, but the long-overdue competition is welcome news for the sector.

Ivvy Like a SABRE or TRAVELPORT for meetings and events Money Raised: $11 million ($15 million AUD) venture, and about $7.5 private.

Headline Investors: Undisclosed Skift Take: CEO Lauren Hall wants to take her booking engine for events to a global audience, having opened UK and U.S. offices last year and already having offices in Australia and South Africa. Meeting planners and venue suppliers like hotels remain mired in systems that don’t talk to each other seamlessly. Other companies, like Social Tables, Groupize, and Breather, are also tackling overlapping parts of the problem. But Hall has a big ambition for Ivvy to create the first global distribution system for events.

Journera Linking scattered data to give companies a unified view of a traveler’s journey Money Raised: Undisclosed

Headline Investors: Undisclosed Skift Take: Travel suppliers know that customers want seamless personalized experiences and relevant offers, but each brand only has a small set of data on any given traveler. Journera is attempting to find a way to piece together the data and help companies make more relevant offers at each stage of a trip. Other companies, including Adara, Adobe, and Sabre, have head starts in tackling this critical industry problem in various ways. We include Journera on our top startups list partly because of faith in the team, led by Co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Katz — who was previously CEO of Orbitz and Swissair — and partly because affiliates of several major U.S. airlines and hotel chains have shown support.

Kiwi.com The fastest-growing travel site Americans have never heard of Money Raised: $1.75 million (€1.5 million)

Headline Investors: Jiri Hlavenka, a Czech entrepreneur Skift Take: How can a startup scale up in five years to support nearly 1,900 workers when it has only raised $1.75 million? Through cash flow or profitable growth. Exhibit A is Kiwi.com, which has sold 6 million tickets since its founding in 2012. It offers a distinctive model of combining flights from non-partner airlines into single itineraries. Think: flying first on Ryanair and then on easyJet on two one-way tickets to reach your final destination.

Lvji Tourism information for the New Silk Road Money Raised: $19 million

Headline Investors: Qianhai Fund of Funds and Pufeng Fund. Skift Take: Anyone who has traveled in China outside of its best-known cities knows that the amount of tourism information infrastructure is limited for Mandarin-speakers — let alone for international visitors. To fill the gap, Lvji has developed audio travel guides for mobile apps and electronic kiosks for destinations. Once the company has solved China’s destination marketing problem, it will have learned enough to build products that could travel far and wide.

Mews A hotel property management system that outwits incumbent players Money Raised: $8.8 million

Headline Investors: Notion Capital, Axivate Capital, and Thayer Ventures Skift Take: Hotel innovation has been held back by the 300 or so property management systems used today. Most property management systems are too complicated for new services to integrate with quickly and smoothly — either because they charge high connectivity fees or are clunky to use. Mews charges nothing for integrations, and it has built its property management system from scratch to work well with the APIs (application programming interfaces) that enable digital innovation. Apaleo, Hotelogix, Impala, and SiteMinder have similar products, but the market can support competition.

MisterFly Like an online travel agency but without the greed Money Raised: $23 million in venture capital, plus other funding

Headline Investors: Montefiore Investment Skift Take: MisterFly is an online travel agency in the sense it takes payments and rebooks customers when anything goes wrong. But its search results look like a metasearch company’s, such as Kayak’s or Skyscanner’s. It has pioneered other innovations, too, such as letting consumers pay for their trips in quarterly installments and selling more fully flexible cancellation insurance than legacy players do. Founded only in 2015, the agency sold about $270 million (€231 million) worth of travel last year and claimed profitability. So far, it has avoided the high cost of acquiring customers online in part by deals with corporate travel agencies, on-the-street agencies, and other partners.

Mobacar Using artificial intelligence to provide semi-personalized car rental offers Money Raised: $10 million

Headline Investors: Delta Partners Skift Take: Travelers shopping for car rentals, airport shuttles, or ride-hailing apps get tired of trawling through long lists of choices. Mobacar taps machine learning to forecast the mode of transport and type of vehicle a traveler will want and aims to push only relevant offers first. It claims to be able to divine the mindset of any given traveler, such as how much he or she would be willing to pay and how much of a rush they may be in. In 2018, the startup forecasts it will process 2 billion searches a month on behalf of clients including Travelport, Gulf Air, and Flight Centre.

PKFare China’s new distribution capability Money Raised: $1.7 million

Headline Investors: Civil Aviation Investment Fund and Caissa Tourism Group Skift Take: Four major middlemen technology companies, including China’s TravelSky, aggregate a huge share of the world’s airline tickets and distribute them to travel agencies. But the giants leave gaps in coverage. A few upstart companies, such as India’s Mystifly and Germany’s Peakwork, aim to plug those gaps with next-generation tech. PKFare is China’s star in this category. It is building a business-to-business marketplace where agencies, suppliers, and companies like TravelSky can access branded airline and hotel wholesale inventory. Finnair, for example, already uses the 200-employee company to distribute its fares to Chinese agencies.

RedDoorz An Oyo with Singaporean characteristics Money Raised: Close to $20 million

Headline Investors: Susquehanna International Group and InnoVen Capital Skift Take: Launched in 2015, RedDoorz is a network of budget branded lodging, with more than 500 properties primarily in Indonesia but also in Singapore and the Philippines. Yes, the company is mimicking a model that others pioneered in India. But we bet that its executives, led by co-founder and CEO Amit Saberwal, have the rare skills needed to lead their team of 180 workers in fending off looming competition from Chinese-owned budget hotels.

Redeam No more paper tickets for tours and activities operators Money Raised: $7.7 million

Headline Investors: Vertical Ventures, Thayer Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures Skift Take: CEO Melanie Ryan Meador now leads a company that helps tourist sites, museums, and other attraction operators automate and digitize many of their administrative processes. The company works with more than 380 resellers and serves nearly 200 customers, such as Gray Line New York and Ripley’s Believe It or Not. The total addressable market is vast. By wiring up operators, the company could enable tours-and-activities businesses to live up to the sector’s recent hype.

The Dyrt The user-generated review trend finally hits camping sites Money Raised: $2.6 million

Headline Investors: Peninsula Ventures Skift Take: Millions of people go camping, but most still use old-school methods to plan their trips. Since its start three years ago, The Dyrt has built campground search mobile apps that have aggregated more than 70,000 pictures, videos, and reviews of campsites. It has rewarded frequent contributors with camping-themed prizes provided by suppliers who are trying to tap into the billions of dollars spent on outdoor recreation each year.

Volantio Zeroing out the melodrama of flight overbooking Money Raised: More than $2.6 million

Headline Investors: International Airlines Group, JetBlue Technology Ventures, and Qantas Ventures Skift Take: This startup helps to predict when a flight might experience a disruption many hours in advance. Then it helps airlines tempt flexible passengers with compensation in exchange for rebooking on other flights. Volantio tackles knotty operational, commercial, and technological problems, and its goal is to help airlines avoid drama at airport gates and boost overall airline revenue CEO Azim Barodawala said United is already testing the startup’s service with real customers.

Yamsafer An online travel agency for Arabic-speaking travelers Money Raised: $10 million

Headline Investors: Sadara Ventures and Global Founders Capital Skift Take: Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle East and North Africa market have been underserved by Western and Chinese online travel multinationals. Yamsafer, which echoes the Arabic word for traveler, has successfully outmaneuvered other regional players to become one of the most-used companies for booking hotels and apartment rentals. Credit the company’s mobile-first approach and its creativity in adapting to local needs for payment methods.

In making our picks, we kept in mind a survey of travel entrepreneurs worldwide that Skift conducted last winter on behalf of travel technology giant Amadeus. Founders told us that their number-one definition of success was “achieving profitability with at least double-digit annual growth.”

We agree. You don’t have to build the next Airbnb to be a success. While most of our picks are not yet profitable, they are demonstrating rapid growth, have promising products that are scalable, and we believe have business models that are likely to be profitable.

How did we do last year? Check out Skift’s 2017 list of top travel startups. A couple of our picks included Alice, which Expedia later took a majority stake in, and Baoku, which was later acquired by Shiji, the hotel tech giant backed by Alibaba Group.

221;761622747;20180605;2018;https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-startup-installs-crypto-point-of-sale-devices-in-indonesia-despite-regulations;"Blockchain startup Pundi X has begun rolling out its cryptocurrency point-of-sales (POS) devices in Indonesia, betting that the central bank will discard its current anti-cryptocurrency stance within three years, the South China Morning Post reported June 4.

A POS terminal is an electronic device used to process card or electronic payments at sales outlets. The idea behind the startup’s devices is to make digital currencies a medium of daily exchange, letting people use virtual currencies to buy necessities like food products in retail stores, cafes and shopping malls where merchants have installed the POS devices.

While cryptocurrency is not legally recognized as a payment instrument in Indonesia, the company’s chief legal counsel David Ben Kay said that the deployment of the POS devices would be completed regardless of regulatory developments. Kay said this is because the device’s cryptocurrency function is not the default option, and it supports payment methods that are compliant with current regulations. He explained:

“The functionality for dealing in cryptocurrency is not automatic, it has to be activated when it is legally permissible in any jurisdiction that the POS is being deployed by the retail store owners.”

Kay suggested that it is only a matter of time before Asian authorities soften their position toward digital currencies. Pundi X has decided to debut its product and services in Indonesia because of the large population and largely cash-based economy.

Pundi X has reportedly said that it received pre-orders for the POS devices from Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Switzerland. The company plans to install up to 100,000 POS devices to build its blockchain-based payment network in Southeast Asia by 2021. This ostensibly would enable the 80 percent of the Indonesian population that does not have access to banking services to start purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies.

Today, the Indonesian Trade Ministry’s Futures Exchange Supervisory Board (Bappebti) signed a decree making cryptocurrency a commodity legally tradable on a stock exchange. Dharma Yoga, a Bappebti official, noted that the Indonesian government will soon release legislation on regulating currency exchange companies, taxation, and combating money laundering and terrorism financing."

Grab, which made its start as a taxi-booking app six years ago, has ventured into areas including payments and food delivery. Earlier this year, it bought Uber Technologies' regional operations.

“We have articulated our vision to be the everyday app of South-East Asia, so we are interested in any tech that enables that vision in terms of becoming a complete O2O (online-to- offline) mobile platform,” Chris Yeo, head of Grab Ventures, told Reuters.

Grab Ventures' current portfolio includes self-driving technology firm Drive.ai and Indonesian payments service Kudo. It will seek to partner eight to ten growth-stage startups over the next 24 months and may invest in a few.

Its CEO Anthony Tan wants to show the world that South-east Asian startups can solve real world problems like poverty.

Singapore

IN A bid to seek out South-east Asia's next tech ""unicorn"", Grab on Tuesday launched Grab Ventures, joining the ranks of Google, Rakuten and other major tech companies that have carved out their own venture or innovation arms.

Grab chief Anthony Tan unveiled the company's initiative to develop innovations in-house, pursue strategic partnerships and groom South-east Asia's next generation of startups valued at US$1 billion or more.

Speaking at the Innovfest unbound tech conference, he said that Grab wants to create 100 million micro-entrepreneurs in the region as it celebrates its sixth birthday.

sentifi.com Market voices on:

""We can transform South-east Asia together. Let's show the world that startups from South-east Asia can solve real world problems like poverty and hunger.""

Grab's move with Grab Ventures follows its recent monetisation of GrabHitch (formerly a non-commercial carpool service) and its launch of Grab&Go (a service where riders sample and purchase snacks and beauty products during rides) - which hint at the pressure Grab is facing from investors to realise more revenue possibilities and to secure its position as South-east Asia's most valuable startup, observers told The Business Times.

Li Jianggan, chief of business consultancy firm mworks, said: ""Without Uber in the picture, and before Go-Jek enters Singapore and other South-east Asian markets, I believe Grab is under investor pressure to demonstrate more revenue possibilities.""

Last week, Grab said it would implement a 10 per cent platform fee on all GrabHitch rides from June 1 to help fund its operating expenses and invest in product enhancements. It was a move that puzzled the ride-hailing community, given that GrabHitch was launched over two years ago as a non-commercial social carpool service to let drivers keep the full amount paid by riders.

Mr Li, who was formerly the Asian head of Easy Taxi, said: ""Again, without competition, I think Grab needs to test its revenue limits by charging for services which were previously free.

""This will determine how sexy its story is when it eventually files for an initial public offering (IPO). Such tests would be difficult to do in a competitive environment.""

Lee Der-Horng, director of the NUS-LTA Transport Research Centre, noted that the platform fee would not significantly affect Grab's driver base. ""Keen GrabHitch drivers will not leave the service simply because of this small sum, as most of them are not treating the service as their source of income, not even revenue.""

Grab Ventures will do two things:

Develop ""cutting-edge technology and build fast-growing businesses"" in-house, such as bike and e-scooter sharing platform GrabCycle; and

Run Velocity, Grab's new accelerator programme for growth-stage startups by providing them with expertise, technical resources and networks to help their expansion.

Through Velocity, Grab will partner some eight to 10 Series B startups over the next two years, and may invest in those that exhibit ""strong synergies"" with Grab; sectors in focus include transport, food, logistics and financial services.

BT understands that Grab Ventures manages an open-end fund, and is open to partnering venture capitalist firms to provide capital for its portfolio startups.

In Singapore, Grab has partnered government agencies such as the info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore and Enterprise SG, to tap their expertise in areas such as capability development, global market access and regulatory support; EDBI, the investment arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board, has also joined as an early partner.

Grab Ventures' portfolio now includes Drive.ai, a California-based self-driving technology startup; iKaaz, an India-based payment experience startup; Kudo, an Indonesian payments startup which Grab acquired in 2017; and GrabCycle.

Chris Yeo, head of Grab Ventures, told BT that Grab wants to expand its online-to-offline solutions: ""If there are existing tech companies already doing that, we'd rather partner them than build (the technologies) ourselves.""

mworks' Mr Li said: ""Any big tech company will need to make its position more secure. That means expanding its offerings to its core user base, forming an ecosystem with it at the centre, and actively seeking and weeding out potential threats. For example, Alibaba bought food delivery company Ele.me to expand its offerings; Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp.""

Arvind Sankaran, venture partner at Jungle Ventures, added that the execution of innovation roadmaps at ""future-oriented companies like Grab"" is expected to be multi-sourced; such companies undertake internal innovation by finding and retaining top talent, and enter into joint ventures such as with Credit Saison, and corporate venture arms.

""While it will help Grab stay on or ahead of the disruption curve and continuously strengthen its competitive moat, it is critical that the focus of Grab Ventures be very precise, driven by a strong thesis and high conviction, so that such activity does not become a distraction,"" he said.

Mr Li agreed that while Grab needs to establish a ""very entrenched ecosystem"" to compete with potential deep-pocketed competitors, ""doing too many things at the same time"" will be a test of the management's focus.

He warned: ""It will be hard to coordinate many business areas, with each having its own objectives and key performance indicators."""
228;761078877;20180602;2018;https://www.zdnet.com/article/qoo10-to-renew-focus-on-singapore-e-commerce-market/;"It may be one of the earliest players in Singapore's e-commerce market, but Qoo10 seems to have lost some of its shine in recent years as more high-profile names such as Lazada, RedMart, Amazon, and Carousell hog the headlines.

Still, the e-commerce site has managed to climb to pole position in Singapore based on traffic and gross merchandise volume (GMV). Launched in June 2010, Qoo10 currently has 2.5 million registered users in the country where it is headquartered. There are more than 10 million product listings on the site.

Alibaba powers ahead in retail as Amazon plays catch up While Amazon remains mum over its on-off-on-again Singapore launch, Alibaba's online-offline strategy has cemented its footprint in the Chinese retail space, with further growth targeted for Southeast Asia. Read More

According to online shopping aggregator iPrice, for the first quarter of 2018, Qoo10 clocked the highest monthly traffic in Singapore at 13.47 million visits, followed by Lazada at 10 million. In the previous quarter, Qoo10 saw 14.41 million monthly visits compared to Lazada's 10.87 million. The Alibaba-owned e-commerce site, however, led in ranking for both Apple App Store and Android Play Store, while Qoo10 placed third in both appstores.

Its general manager Sam Too acknowledged that Lazada was narrowing the gap and nipping at its heels. He noted, though, that the Singapore e-commerce market still was nascent and remained largely untapped.

Too said Qoo10 was ""refocusing"" on the city-state and tapping the market as a springboard into Southeast Asia, where it was targeting to be the region's second-largest player in the next three to five years.

He told ZDNet the company was planning for its Series C funding round this year and, if successful, would use the money to drive its expansion plans.

He said Qoo10 had spent the last five years focused on the Japanese market, which was its fastest growing and where the site rose to claim the fourth-largest share. In February, its parent company Giosis sold the local business to eBay for an amount that Too declined to reveal, but he said the deal would see eBay divesting all its shares in Giosis' businesses outside of Japan.

While the sale gave the company a cash boost, it also meant Qoo10 would have to look elsewhere to ensure its sustainability, especially since Japan was its largest contributor, accounting for 50 percent of its GMV. Singapore was its second-largest.

""No, we're not late,"" Too said, when asked if there still were growth opportunities in the Singapore market, where the likes of Lazada--backed by Alibaba's deep pockets and dominance in China--and Carousell and Carro with their latest funding rounds, already had been ramping up their expansion plans over the past couple of years.

While noting that Singapore was a challenging landscape, he said Qoo10 had first-mover advantage in the market where it had ""groomed"" the e-commerce industry a decade ago. ""From out point, this industry is still only at its infancy. There is no clear winner at this point,"" he said, adding that the market had the potential to grow three-fold by 2025 and another five-times by 2028.

Getting the small to go big online

Specifically, he pointed to two key focus areas for Qoo10: small and midsize businesses (SMBs) as well as consumers aged between 35 and 45, who had only just started to shop online.

SMBs, for instance, accounted for 99 percent of Singapore's local enterprises, but many had yet to fully engage the digital world, running websites that had little traffic, Too said.

""We want to engage these brick-and-mortar business owners and encourage them to try out e-commerce with minimum risks and resources...that's where the [growth] potential is,"" he said.

Merchants peddling their wares on Qoo10 do not have to pay a monthly subscription. Instead, the e-commerce operator takes a cut of each transaction the merchant successfully closes.

""So if they don't see any sale on our platform, they don't lose anything,"" Too said, adding that the company had a salesforce dedicated to engaging and guiding SMBs on how to use its online tools to promote their products.

It also meant these small retailers would need to learn how to sell and manage the entire cycle of growing their business on a digital platform, including responding to customer queries and reviews.

In addition, they had to ensure their backend operations could support Qoo10's three-hour delivery service, he said. The site processed 1.5 million transactions in the first quarter this year.

To differentiate its offerings from the competitors, he underscored the need for Qoo100 to constantly test new ideas and bring new things to the table, including new apps, news contests, and new services.

In addition, he said it was looking to bolster its grocery offering, though, by tapping different merchants to sell such products on the site, rather than storing its own inventory.

""We have mini Redmarts,"" Too quipped, noting that a FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) retail chain processed S$500,000 worth of transactions on average each month, peaking at S$800,000 last November. He revealed that the merchant, three years ago, had started by offering diapers and formula milk on Qoo10 because these items were bulky and cumbersome to store in their physical stores.

He added that the site now was exploring the use of retail outlets as pickup points, from which online customers could choose to pick up their purchases at these physical points.

Asked if the business was profitable, he declined to give specifics but said Qoo10 was focusing on its bottomline and confident it was running a sustainable business.

Apart from Singapore, the company currently operates online marketplaces in four other markets: Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and China.

Its focus for now, though, was on Singapore, Too said, adding that it would look to ramp up its presence in Indonesia and Malaysia in about two years when these markets were ""ready"". He noted that some e-commerce markets in the region remained immature and needed more time to stabilise."

A research by Google indicated that SEA’s internet economy growth has exceeded expectations and has reached $50 billion in 2017, outpacing earlier growth expectations by 35%.

Q1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc, Also read Lear Capital: Financial Products You Should Avoid?

An earlier research by Google estimates that around 3.8 million new users will come online each month in the region. This makes Southeast Asia the fastest growing internet region in the world between 2015 and 2020. This, combined with a burgeoning young population (70% of SEA is under the age of 40), rising disposable incomes (all six major SEA countries will break the estimated $3,000 GDP/capita barrier), greater availability of payment systems, and a lack of available organized retail will spur the growth of the internet economy and is estimated to a value of $200 billion by 2025.

Vital indicators of SEA’s eCommerce potential

1. SEA is a mobile-first economy

The average Southeast Asian spends about 3.6 hours utilising mobile internet every single day. This figure is not just the highest in the world but is the only region with this unique statistic.

Analysing data from six major cities in the region (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand), a separate study highlighted ‘m-commerce’ has grown on average 19% and now captures 72% of the overall eCommerce web traffic. Leading the pack is Indonesia which now has a staggering 87% share of mobile traffic. Across the region, desktop traffic has not exceeded 30% of web traffic indicating the importance of having a mobile friendly platform for eCommerce merchants.

2. Southeast Asians spend almost twice as much time as Americans in ecommerce marketplaces

On average Southeast Asians spends about 140 minutes shopping online each month, making it twice as much as Americans in eCommerce marketplaces.

Shoppers in the region are relentless consumers as they are very likely to shop during working hours as well. Considering the average number of orders of the local country as reference (100%), the number of orders is highest between 9am and 5pm when people are traditionally at work or school. However, this will defer for Singaporeans who seem to enjoy evening shopping more than other countries, peaking at 10pm.

Southeast Asians are more likely to conduct a purchase during weekdays as opposed to weekends. Nevertheless, online traffic on mobile devices are at its highest during weekends, indicating that consumers are more likely to browse and discover products over the weekend and conducts their purchases by weekdays.

3. Southeast Asian startups raised a total of US$7.86 billion from investors in 2017

At 0.18 percent of GDP, the amount of investment into Southeast Asian startups is on par with India’s and a vote of confidence in SEA’s huge internet potential. As of 2016, more than US$2.52 billion was raised by Southeast Asian eCommerce startups.

This figure tripled in 2017 raising a total of US$7.86 billion from investors, that’s the highest growth since 2013 and came about despite the number of deals falling to 320 from 335 according to Tech in Asia.

4. Low level of correlation between conversion rate and the level of maturity of each eCommerce market

Among the most important metrics for any eCommerce operator is their conversion rate. Conversion rate reflects both the quality of a company’s marketing activities and the website’s effectiveness. In its simplest definition, conversion rate is the percentage of website visits that turn into a product purchase. Improving conversion rate can have a dramatic effect on the bottom line and profitability of a business.

Interestingly, Vietnam merchants are leading the way with a conversion rate 30% higher than the average. Singapore displays the second highest conversion rate, closely tied with Indonesia.

5. The Basket Size results is closely correlated to the GDP per capita of each country

Basket size is another key metric for any eCommerce operator which heavily impacting the unit economics profitability of the business. The metric measures the average total amount spent for every order made by customer over a defined period of time.

The basket size is structurally different among verticals and the market positioning of each merchant. Our large sample of merchants from a variety of verticals is mitigating such factors, thus making the basket size comparison among countries particularly interesting.

Singapore has the highest GDP per capita ($90,530) while Vietnam has the lowest GDP per capita ($6,880). Relatively, Singapore’s merchants score highest with a basket size of $91, 3.7x higher than their Vietnamese counterparts with an average basket size of $23.

6. Bank transfer is the most popular payment method across SEA

Due to low credit card penetration in the region (with the exception of Singapore), eCommerce players in SEA had to face unique challenges, unbeknownst to the western ecommerce markets. As a consequence of this structural shortcoming, a much more diverse range of payment solutions have proliferated in the region.

Cash on Delivery is offered by more than 80% of the players in both Vietnam and the Philippines. Bank transfer is another popular payment method across SEA with respectively 94%, 86%, and 79% of merchants in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand offering it. In Thailand and Vietnam, almost 50% of merchants offer offline point of sales (ie. 7/11)

Payment by instalments proves to be very popular (and increasingly so) in both Vietnam (47% of merchants) and Indonesia (42%).

Each country displays very different patterns which highlights the challenges that merchants face when expanding regionally with a one-size fits all approach. Hence, benefitting merchants what are flexible and ensure that they are able to cater to the needs of each unique market.

Barriers eCommerce players must overcome to realise the industry’s true potential

Among the most pressing challenges hampering the growth of the internet economy is the shortage of local talents in the region. Google notes that this issue is the most pressing when compared to five other key challenges. This has led to Southeast Asian players opening tech hubs in other regions such as China, India, and the U.S. where top talents are more readily available.

Emerging companies grapple with identifying the right executives choosing between highly experienced foreigners or nationals who understand the local context but lacked experience. Responses to these challenges by SEA start-ups has been mixed due to the diversity of the economy and that no one-size-fits all solution is best suited to meet this challenge.

Though highly challenging, the future remains bright as governments and education institutions across the region has spotted eCommerce sector’s high growth potential have put in initiatives to fill the missing gap. Governments such as Malaysia has dedicated significant resources to ensure that higher education institutions have the ability to produce high-quality graduates in digital technology and this is evident in other countries as well.

On top of this, a wide variety of performance-driven affiliate partners are available, enabling eCommerce players the ability to obtain local expertise with through partnerships. Major players in the region such as Lazada is a good example. They actively partner with on-ground local partners to expand their customer base. Pierre Poignant, CEO Lazada eLogistics (LEL) & Co-founder of Lazada states that the organization already works with more than 100 companies in delivery and cross-border logistics from Ninjavan in Singapore to ride-hailing start-up Go-Jek in Jakarta.

As the year 2025 draws nearer, time will tell if the internet economy’s aspirations will come to pass. To overcome these hurdles and grab hold of the future, Google stated that the success of SEA startups in the next phase of the ecosystem will depend largely on how well CEOs can grow themselves as the internet economy matures in the years to come.

Having become giants in a only a few year, these companies are now regional and global leaders in their respective fields: from e-commerce to ride-hailing, from gaming to travel and digital payments.

The explosive growth of the digital economy of Southeast Asia has fostered the growth of six unicorns: companies that have reached a valuation above 1 billion US $. Starting from humble beginnings, they have succeeded in their field and raised capital that has valued their success beyond what most tech companies ever dream of.

With more than 300 million internet users across the region, the six unicorns already reach a large part of the population to deliver their services. As the Southeast Asian internet sector, already worth more than 50 Billion US $, is poised to continue growing in the coming years, they should be among the main beneficiaries of this expansion.

With the continued growth of internet users, the six unicorns listed hereafter will continue to reap the benefits of easier ways to contact new users and provide innovative services, together with the lower costs associated with communication technologies.

Singapore startups can now gain faster entry to India's vibrant startup ecosystem to form partnerships and co-innovate with Indian startups after a state-owned enterprise here has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with one of the largest global entrepreneurship organisations of Indian-origin.

The MoU between Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) Singapore was signed yesterday, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival in the country on a three-day visit.

The MoU kick-starts an incubation programme that aims to foster collaboration between Singapore and Indian start-ups through jointly organised networking events, workshops and sessions with in-market mentors.

Singapore startups can now gain faster entry to India's vibrant startup ecosystem to form partnerships and co-innovate with Indian startups, said ESG in a statement on Wednesday.

The MOU with TiE Singapore, one of the largest global entrepreneurship organisations of Indian-origin which began in Silicon Valley and boast of strong funding muscles and deep pockets, kickstarts the ""Singapore – India Incubation Programme"" by Startup SG1, led by Enterprise Singapore, with the support of Trade Associations and Chambers and startup partners.

As a start, TiE Singapore will be running a startup mission in July with 10 Singapore startups to meet with Indian startups, corporates, mentors and investors to partner and co-innovate solutions in fintech, e-services and deeptech.

With a network of 11,000 members globally, India currently constitutes one third of TiE's global membership. TiE was formed by Silicon Valley-based Indian technologists.

Tan Soon Kim, Assistant Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Singapore, said, ""India is an up-and-coming hotspot for global startups and businesses. The growth of India's startup landscape has been remarkable.""

""The Singapore - India Incubation Programme aims to introduce ideas and concepts between the ecosystems of both countries and foster collaboration between companies in each other's markets and in Southeast Asia. Over time, we aim to establish a series of key innovation nodes within India to form an innovation network for Singapore companies to tap on,"" said Tan.

Puneet Pushkarna, Chairman of TiE, said, ""The strategic collaboration between TiE and Enterprise Singapore would strengthen the bridge between India and Singapore's startup ecosystem, which today are amongst the most vibrant in the world.""

""With 19 chapters in India alone, TiE provides the fattest pipe of entrepreneurial connectivity between the two countries and we hope to enhance market access opportunities for startups on both sides. We are confident that the platform would further proliferate networking amongst innovators and allow for the development and adoption of ideas, flow of capital and implementation of technically challenging solutions for the betterment of the society at large,"" said Pushkarna.

In line with the ""Singapore – India Incubation Programme"" by Startup SG, Enterprise Singapore will be organising an iAdvisory Seminar: ""Startups in India"" on June 12 2018, to help Singapore companies understand the startup landscape in India, opportunities and how to enter the market.

India's startup ecosystem ranks third globally, with over 4,750 startups. Its key focus areas include e-commerce, fintech, healthtech and edutech.

The number of startups in India grew 12 per cent in 2016 and is expected to cross 10,000 by 2020.

In 2017, the value of startup funding amounted to approximately USD 13.7 billion, significantly higher than the USD 4.06 billion of 2016 and the USD 8.4 billion of 2015, said the statement, citing industry data.

The growth is fuelled by increased Government support through startup schemes that eased registration and gave Indian startups priority in Government-led projects and rising middle class which led to a boom in startups tapping into the consumer space, it said. — PTI."
232;760637566;20180531;2018;https://www.livemint.com/Money/WHUNtHVgaQtZX8qWUgiLvI/India-today-a-bit-like-Silicon-Valley-of-1980s.html;"Doug Coulter, partner and head of Asian private equity investments, LGT Capital Partners.

The Asia-Pacific private equity (PE) industry achieved its best all-around performance to date in 2017. Deals were larger, investment was broader and large global investors were more active than ever, according to Bain’s Asia Pacific Private Equity Report 2018.

India was among the leaders of this growth, with India-focused funds growing by 48% to an aggregate $5.7 billion in funds raised and with a total deal value of $26.4 billion, the highest in the past 10 years. Moreover, at approximately $9 billion, Indian dry powder remained at levels similar to 2015 and 2016, indicating no dearth of capital for high-quality deals. Investments and exits in India also had a strong 2017, surpassing their respective previous highs.

“We are optimistic about India’s future today. It is our second largest investment market with almost 20% of our capital deployed there,” says Doug Coulter, partner and head of Asian PE investment activities at LGT Capital Partners, a Switzerland-based global multi-alternatives platform with $60 billion in assets under management, out of which PE accounts for $30 billion. Investment into Asian PE is more than $3 billion. A significant sum out of this is invested in India.

“While China is our largest Asian PE market with 50% capital deployed, you could argue that relative to GDP (gross domestic product), and relative to the opportunity set, we are overweight India, as China is a $14 trillion economy versus India’s $2.5 trillion,” he emphasizes.

Coulter says when investing in India (and elsewhere), “LGT is really trying to find exceptional private equity managers and exceptional promoters. We want our managers to invest in great companies at valuations that make sense and then hopefully work with those companies to effect change and improve the businesses.”

He points out that, increasingly, it is getting easier to find that ecosystem in India.

LGT’s model in India is to be extremely selective. The firm has a relatively small number of core manager relationships that are used to source additional direct opportunities. “There are two things that are tricky when deciding where to allocate your capital,” Coulter says. “One is deciding where to allocate. The second and more difficult part is getting access to the best managers in India, some of whom are oversubscribed multiple times. What we like to see is a great performance from a manager who comes back and raises a similar sized fund next time around.”

Explaining LGT’s India investment portfolio, he says the firm wants to allocate some of its capital in the venture capital space and in early-stage businesses, as well as in the emerging buyout space. “There is so much low hanging fruit in Indian companies. India has seen a substantial uptick in distribution both generally, and in our own portfolio as well. That is the biggest game changer.”

Coulter points to Morgan Stanley’s 2017 report, which notes that India is set to become a $6 trillion economy by the mid-2020s, driven in large part by digitization, technology and venture capital. He thinks this is a realistic assessment.

“India’s current economic policy is headed in the right direction from an investment standpoint. That is why investors like us are optimistic about the country,” according to Coulter. Edited excerpts from an interview:

What has worked well for LGT in India?

One of the things that worked really well in India over the past five years for us is venture investing, mostly in the telecommunications, media and technology space, but also selectively in the consumer space. India today, just like China, is a little bit like Silicon Valley in the 1980s.

It is, of course, not exactly the same, but what is the same is that investors like us are trying to lock in allocations with the best local and international venture capital firms in India and China. For investors just starting now, it is in fact already too late as the best such managers are massively oversubscribed based on excellent recent returns and distributions that have increased.

The two areas of investment we like are also, Made in India consumer-based companies, and also the opportunity to back a bunch of technology guys sitting in Bangalore who are building products for the world. You have unbelievably good engineering talent in India, at a fraction of the cost of the US. At an early stage, you can often buy into these companies at attractive valuations and you have a global marketplace for the sort of software and products they are building.

What sectors are you excited about going forward as an investor in India?

One sector we really like in India is the financial sector, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) that are reaching out to the unbanked, whether it is microlending or just providing small loans to entrepreneurs who live outside the large metros. It remains a huge opportunity even though we already own many of these firms on an indirect basis.

In public markets, NBFCs trade at very high valuations that do not make sense from a global perspective but public sector banks are losing market share and NBFCs are selling financial products and services to the rising lower and middle classes; so maybe in this sector, high valuations are justified. It’s a similar argument with Fintech, another sector that we like.

Now, when it comes to more generic consumer businesses, we need to be careful not to pay too much for future growth. We don’t fall into the trap of saying India is big, there are 1.2 billion people, a rising middle-class, therefore, we can pay 30 times for this company that makes biscuits.

Maybe that company is worth six times and is a good investment at that level but even if we love a sector we need to keep valuation in mind.

Do the home-grown Made in India brands seem like an exciting theme for LGT?

There is a debate right now in India among private equity professionals as to whether or not there is a huge opportunity to build Made in India brands on the consumer side.

While many players say the market is just too shallow and it is really hard to execute and build scale quickly, others say the opposite. There are a handful of early-stage funds that are focusing not just on technology but on building homegrown Indian brands. Time will tell whether this creates value for investors.

The key question is whether India has reached a tipping point in terms of a sizable middle-class economy and a consumer base that has the spending power to build up these Indian brands.

For us, backing these emerging Indian brands is interesting but only as part of a much larger, diversified portfolio.

How has the PE asset class performed in India in the recent past?

Overall, I think, it is fair to say the PE asset class in India has disappointed in the past. Expectations have always been too high. That said, we see many positive signs in the current economic and political environment and are cautiously optimistic about the future. The key is to be selective whether one is backing managers or individual companies.

What do you see as the key challenges in PE that India needs to overcome to perform better in the near future?

1) A shallow market

A lot of money poured into India in the pre-global financial crisis (GFC) era. It was the kind of market where if you were coming out of a large investment bank with a good resume, you could go around the world talking about India and quite easily raise $300 million with very few questions being asked. So, too much money came into a market that was actually quite shallow and the returns were disappointing.

Today, a small handful of elite managers raise funds before they are launched but many still struggle to raise capital because their historical returns have been disappointing.

A recent McKinsey study notes that between 2001 and 2014, there was $100 billion of PE capital that came into India, backing about 3,000 firms. The returns were quite disappointing overall, but if you were with the right groups, in the right companies, you did very well. We think that will continue to be the case.

2) Paying high valuations on the way in, hard to make money on the way out.

Probably the biggest criticism levelled at PE managers in India is the high multiples paid for businesses. India has usually been an expensive market on the public side and on the private side as well. If you overpay at entry, it is hard to make money on the way out. Those who do not pay attention to valuation are unlikely to make money over the long term.

3) Small firms listed on stock exchange

Another problem with PE in India is the approximately 7,000 listed Indian firms. While there are a lot of very large important firms listed, the vast majority are very small and probably never should have been listed as the shares rarely trade.

The issue is these are exactly the kind of firms, often family owned with revenue less than $100 million, that, in markets like China, are great targets for PE.

The founder opens up his company to professional capital and the private equity firm comes in, sits on the board, adds value, adds international connections, etc. In India, that whole private market opportunity is much smaller in part due to the size of the public market universe.

4) PE investment into listed companies

There are several thousand SMEs in India that are publicly listed and, unfortunately, a lot of PE firms have pursued these firms as investments. While there are always good justifications for doing so, at the end of the day, this introduces volatility into your private market portfolio.

Most limited partners or LPs, want private companies in their PE portfolios. The other concern, of course, is the reduced ability to do proper diligence on the way in, and a lack of control over the company once you are an investor. While there are a handful of PE managers that have done well on an opportunistic basis in the listed market, it is something most LPs want to minimize.

5) Too much funds chasing wrong sectors

In the pre-GFC years, because a lot of PE funds raised too much capital, they had to deploy it in capital-intensive industries. Therefore, you saw a lot of GPs investing in infrastructure or even realty. That did not end well.

What worries you about the current investing environment in India?

Pre-Modi, India was the most unloved emerging market in the world. LPs had no interest in the same market they were throwing money at in 2007. But LGT continued to invest in India post-GFC and those vintage years have been extremely successful.

Post-Modi, LPs suddenly got very interested again in India. Fund-raising is back to near all-time highs and there are quite a few Indian funds that have a one and done close with many investors desperate to maximize allocations. Maybe this is a warning sign that these will not be good vintage years.

Fund sizes are creeping up again as they did pre GFC. Managers always say, ‘well, GDP is growing, the companies are bigger, we can deploy our capital, the opportunities are better,’ which is true. But PE is a pro-cyclical industry.

When times are good, the fund sizes get bigger, the deals get bigger, the valuations get higher, the vintage years are not as good and the returns are disappointing. So the current environment does concern us.

That said, we still need to deploy capital so our job is to find good stewards of that capital, be disciplined on the direct side and deploy through the cycles as we never know for sure which will be the great vintage years and which will be less good.

Many people look at India and make the argument it is a lot like China 10-15 years ago with regards to PE investment climate and opportunity. Do you agree?

While there are clearly some similarities, it is important not to overstate the comparisons. There are just far more private companies of scale in China to invest in than India.

China has great entrepreneurs, as does India, but India is just a shallower market. Being selective in terms of where you invest your capital is even more important in India.

As a limited partner, we meet many managers, most of whom talk about the Indian consumer or the Chinese consumer with most saying more or less the same thing.

The question is have you made money backing Indian consumers or Chinese consumers and do you have the right network to start with. It is not just about knowing the right people, but also being able to assess the quality of the promoter, the quality of the business model and the scale of the opportunity.

How does India compare with South-East Asia in your view for PE investing?

If I compare India to South-East Asia, it is a little bit like comparing China to India. It is true that Asean (Association of Southeast Nations) is a $2.6 trillion economy—so, about the same size as India. However, it is a myriad of countries, languages, laws, and regulations. So that is one problem.

At least, if you are an Indian private equity firm, you can set up shop in Mumbai, Delhi and maybe Bangalore, and cover the whole country. Yes, there are many languages in India, but you can work that out. Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam—these are all fundamentally different places, with differing economies, languages, cultures, and politics, so the big issue is where do you even put your team and how do you construct that team? A lot of South-East Asian managers end up in Singapore, but then, you are still getting on a plane and travelling to Bangkok or Jakarta, so are you really local? These individual Asean markets are also quite small, as are the targets that PE is pursuing. Finally, too many first-time funds have raised capital, not entirely unlike what we saw in India pre-GFC.

The assumption is that returns from these recent vintages will not be great. The other problem in South-East Asia is there is still little proof of concept in terms of fund returns and exits.

There are many examples of great private equity investments where people have come in and done good deals and have made good money. But at a fund level, it has been pretty disappointing."

A University of Queensland-led study has revealed the practice is funding conservation worldwide, including in countries with high global conservation priorities, such as Indonesia and Costa Rica.

UQ School of Biological Sciences Fuller Lab PhD candidate Eduardo Gallo-Cajiao said crowdfunding had harnessed the power of the internet to magnify the power of public appeals.

“Raising funds is critical for conserving biodiversity, and anecdotal evidence had indicated that crowdfunding was being used to support a variety of conservation activities,” he said.

“Yet its magnitude and allocation were largely unknown.”

Mr Gallo-Cajiao said the study found conservationists had raised more than $6.3 million through crowdfunding since 2009, with land and marine projects delivered in 80 countries and across all continents.

“We found 208 species have been the explicit focus of crowdfunded projects, many of them iconic and of high conservation concern, such as the orange-bellied parrot from south-eastern Australia and the vaquita porpoise from the Gulf of California.

“Crowdfunded conservation projects are helping protect wilderness areas in remote areas of Tasmania, reduce killings of African lions in Tanzania, and funding research that informs conservation of the Californian coast,” he said.

“It’s supporting research and monitoring, management, advocacy and outreach.

He said crowdfunding also enabled experimentation with novel and risky ideas that were difficult to fund through traditional sources.

""For instance, a crowdfunded project supported the purchase and training of two Maremma sheepdogs to guard a penguin colony in southeastern Australia, protecting these flightless birds from fox predation.""

The study, published in Conservation Biology (https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13144), involved UQ’s Carla Archibald, Rachel Friedman, Rochelle Steven, and Professor Richard Fuller, and Edward Game of The Nature Conservancy, Associate Professor Tiffany Morrison of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and Associate Professor Euan Ritchie of Deakin University.

Speaking of startups, the business world is strangely interconnected. While one may consider business as the universal unifying objective, resources, in terms of both products and monies, are in a constant fluid state, transposing from one country to another.

Take the Walmart-Flipkart deal in India, for instance. While the Indian ecommerce sector is going to exponentially expand as a result of the deal and Walmart-Flipkart’s rivalry with Amazon likely to spike, speculation is also ripe that Flipkart will only be getting a measly billion dollar from the deal. Much of the acquisition money will be going to investors, a majority of whom are foreign bred.

Also, India is on the verge of an economic transcendence. Today, India’s technological and economic boom is at the centre stage of global political dialectics. No wonder, countries such as the US, UK, Israel, Canada, etc. are reaching out to us for collaborations and to be a part of our startup ecosystem and culture. India is setting the tone of a universal business language, this makes it even more important to understand the global developments in terms of tech and startup ecosystem.

Therefore, global business events, far and yet so close to every entrepreneur, are without any geographical barrier! From today, Inc42 will bring an international weekly rundown of stories that will educate you, entertain you, and keep you alerted about the startup landscape across the globe.

Here are the important stories from the tech and startup world for the week gone by.

GO-JEK to launch international expansion into four new markets

GO-JEK has confirmed that it is to invest $500 million in its international expansion strategy. The company will enter Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines within the next few months, starting with ride-hailing but ultimately aiming to replicate the multiple-service business model that has made it the market leader in Indonesia.

GO-JEK is currently working with regulators and other stakeholders across the region to pave the way for the new operations. The companies will be run by local founding teams, with GO-JEK providing technological support and expertise gathered over the past three years as Indonesia’s most revolutionary tech business. The local companies will determine their own brands and identities to ensure good traction in each new market.

GDPR, Europe’s new privacy law, is officially here

The General Data Protection Regulation, Europe’s highly anticipated new privacy law which is expected to rein in tech companies misusing user data, went into effect on May 25.

The new law requires any company that operates in the EU or any company that serves EU citizens to follow strict new privacy guidelines meant to protect consumers from companies abusing their personal data. Companies that fail to comply could face financial penalties as high as 4 percent of their annual revenue. For companies like Facebook, Google and Apple, that could amount to billions of dollars in fines.

Facebook labeling political ads to attempt another American election sabotaged situation

Facebook on May 24 will start labeling political and issue ads on the social network — a move intended to keep foreign governments from buying ads that might influence U.S. voters. Political advertisers will also need to register with Facebook by “confirming their identity and location” with the company.

The changes are meant to prevent another situation like the one Facebook faced during the 2016 US presidential election, in which a troll army with ties to the Kremlin created fake posts and bought ads in an effort to sow discord.

The major issue still facing the company, though, is how it will identify issue ads that don’t necessarily endorse a specific candidate but that touch on a wide range of political themes, such as civil rights, immigration, the environment and the military.

Even if Mark Zuckerberg got to cherry-pick his questions in the EU Parliament in Belgium and give no specific answers to the hour long questioning session, Facebook appears to have identified where it needs to work to win its users’ trust again."

4 Major Things in Building Startup Business

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - There are always ups and downs in building a startup business. Problems will arise during the early years of running the business. The owner of Ikan Segar Application or PT Ikan Segar Indonesia, Ronald David, said that no one knows the struggle of doing a business until they experience it themselves.

“Businessman never knows until they try,” Ronald said during Ngobrol Tempo discussion in Trisakti University, West Jakarta, on Friday, May 25.

What are the points to note when starting and maintaining startup business? Here are the tips to become a good businessman.

1. Find social problems

The Founder of Agio.co.id, Lucky Bayu Purnomo, stated that he started doing business after observing social problems arise in society. It made him know what the society needs at that time and what kind of business that will sell in the market.

“That is the basic things to get the data, by observations to build startups and sustains,” said the economist.

2. Innovation

Ronald David explained the relation of the way of thinking and innovation. He recounted his experience in the past when he founding the PT Ikan Segar Indonesia. At that time, his startup company tried to sell any kind of fish online. Ronald knows people always relate fish with stench and muddy places, so he innovated a new way to sell the fish by using styrofoam to package and sell it online.

3. Occupied the business

The Co-founder & CEO of Ajarin Indonesia, Caroline Samosir, advised that when doing the business, they should be occupied with the business because, in 20 years or 30 years, it will still benefit them. Caroline also said to not expect big profits in the early years of doing business.

4. Stress is a part of being in business

Stress is a normal state when someone failed doing a startup business. When this happens, try to do fun activities and give time to relax. “Stress is also a part of being in business,” said Caroline.

In addition, frustration provides benefits unexpectedly, or at least that is what Ronald felt. He said that when he is frustrated, he gets new ideas to the business, “the idea came up from the frustration,” Ronald said.

Indonesian startup Go-Jek, which offers ride-hailing, food delivery and online payments, said on May 24 that it would invest $500 million in expanding into four new Southeast Asian markets: Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.

Go-Jek, whose name is a play on the word for Indonesia’s ubiquitous motorbike taxis, has grown rapidly since launching eight years ago. Along with more traditional services, it also connects customers with hairdressers, cleaners and masseurs.

The firm raised a higher-than-expected $1.5 billion in a fundraising concluded earlier this year that included Google, Temasek, Tencent and JD.com, and valued the company at $5 billion.

On March 26, Uber Technologies announced its exit from Southeast Asia, and a sale of its business in the region to rival Grab."
240;758608311;20180524;2018;https://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/todays-headlines/ride-hailing-unicorn-go-jek-to-expand-beyond-indonesian-borders/item8813;"Go-Jek's strategy to grow into neighboring countries will be rather similar to the approach it had used in Indonesia. In the first stage it will only deliver ride-hailing services, meaning that people can order car or motorcycle rides through an application on their smartphone. Then, in a later stage, other services may be added. In Indonesia Go-Jek now offers a wide range of services through its mobile app ranging from food-delivery, massages, package delivery, to cleaning services. It also added digital payment services and therefore acquired three financial technology (fintech) companies in 2017.

Go-Jek's expansion move means that the company is set to challenge Singapore-based Grab in the other big (emerging) markets of Southeast Asia. Currently, these two companies are the two biggest forces on the Indonesian market, with Go-Jek in leading position (but the gap with Grab is narrow). In the four new markets Go-Jek will team up with local partners as part of its expansion strategy.

Nadiem Makarim, Go-Jek CEO and Founder, commented on the expansion plans saying: ""Consumers are happiest when they have choice and at the moment, people in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines do not feel that they are getting enough when it comes to ride-hailing. We hope that as we arrive in new markets, we will quickly become everyone's go-to lifestyle app. That is our aspiration. In the meantime, we hope our presence will provide the welcome competition markets need to thrive"".

Go-Jek has seen significant capital injections in recent months. In January 2018 Caesar Sengupta, Google Vice President of Product Management, confirmed that Google invested in Go-Jek. He said it is part of Google's strategy to support and to participate in the thriving Internet economy of Indonesia. With more than 133 million Indonesians ""being online"" in the world's largest archipelago (and the world's fifth-largest Internet population), Internet and Internet-related activities have become increasingly important in this country. Meanwhile, with only about 50 percent of the total population currently being online (Indonesia numbers more than 260 million inhabitants), the journey has only just begun.

One month later, in February 2018, more capital injections into Go-Jek followed from companies such as Astra International, JD.COM, Meituan, Tencent and Temasek. In total Go-Jek raised approximately USD $1.5 billion through the fundraising round, exceeding its initial target of USD $1.2 billion. Go-Jek is currently valued at USD $5 billion.

Having success in a foreign ride-hailing market is not an easy job. Indeed Grab managed to get a strong hold of the Southeast Asian market but generally the market is dominated by local startups. Therefore, Uber Technologies Inc decided to sell its operations and assets in the Southeast Asian region to Grab in March 2018. Through this consolidation-move, Uber will obtain a 27.5 percent stake in Grab, while Uber's chief executive officer joins the board of Grab.

This development should turn Grab into a stronger player, both in Indonesia and in other markets in Southeast Asia. Therefore, Go-Jek's decision to challenge Grab in other Southeast Asian markets is a brave one but it will become very difficult to threaten Grab's leading position outside Indonesia.

The Southeast Asian region is one of the world's most attractive regions for the digital economy as this region is home to 640 million people, while the region is also characterized by rapid economic growth as well as rapidly rising smartphone and Internet penetration. Therefore, Southeast Asian ride-hailing market is forecast to reach a value of USD $20.1 billion by 2025.

His startup mixes prefab homes and luxury branding to revolutionize the real estate industry – not just in the Philippines, but also around the world.

Its innovativeness has made it the first startup in the Philippines to achieve ‘unicorn’ status, a term used to describe a company that has a valuation of US$1 billion.

According to TechinAsia, it is one of the fastest companies to achieve this billion-dollar status in the Southeast region.

Early last year, prolific startup accelerator 500 Startups poured money into Revolution, bringing the company’s valuation to US$256 million.

Then in October 2017, a fresh round of funding led by Singaporean venture capital firm K2 Global raised an undisclosed amount that brought the startup over the billion-dollar mark.

Real Estate Runs In His Blood

Robbie, the youngest to be featured in Forbes’ 2017 list of the 50 richest people in the Philippines, belongs to a family that has made its fortune in real estate.

His father – Jose E.B. Antonio – owns Century Properties and shook up the real estate market by selling an aspirational lifestyle to Filipinos, and played to their penchant for celebrities and branded names.

As the managing director, Robbie is responsible for spearheading the company’s direction and branded collaborations like the Trump Tower in Manila, a Paris Hilton-branded collection of condos, Milano Resides by Versace, Acqua Livingstone by Missoni Home, and the world’s first Forbes Tower.

“I’ve done about US$2.1 billion worth of branded deals for the family business,” Robbie said in an interview with Tech Wire Asia.

He added that this hands-on experience has made him “understand the pain points in real estate”, and working on these glitzy projects is what led him to start up his own company.

Established in December 2015, Revolution Precrafted is a manifestation of Robbie’s dream to fuse his experience in constructing stunning, exclusive buildings with his deep love for contemporary art.

Robbie is actually an avid art collector who has been recognised as one of the top collectors in the world by Artnet in 2016, placed alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Bernard Arnault, Paul Allen, and other point-one percenters.

According to him, this obsession with art is what led him to develop branded homes for the middle market and ultimately want to make designer homes accessible to more people.

“My inspiration for the project came from my own passion and experience in art collection. I wanted to make architecture collectible – but at an accessible price point,” Robbie said in an interview with Huffington Post.

“Revolution preserves the exclusivity of art collection and by introducing prefabricated technology, it expands the potential of ownership.”

Making Designer Homes More Accessible

Revolution Precrafted sells highly customisable prefabricated properties such as modular homes, condominiums, pavilions, pop-up retail stores, and fitness centres.

© Provided by Vulcan Post

Developed by world-renowned architects and designers like the late Zaha Hadid, David Salle, Tom Dixon, and Marcel Wanders, the homes are priced at an average of US$120,000.

Prefabricated homes, often referred to as prefab homes or simply prefabs, are specialist dwelling types of prefabricated building, which are manufactured off-site in advance, usually in standard sections that can be easily shipped and assembled.

This means that you don’t have to go through the hassle of hiring a whole team of contractors, manufacturers or builders, and also save on the astronomical fees of commissioning a famous architect.

The only instructions Robbie gave his designers was to make a structure from 50 to 250 square meters with components that could fit in a shipping container.

Through his ties with quality fabricators here and abroad, Revolution can also complete the developments faster.

A 50-square-meter home can be done in as fast as 90 days as opposed to the usual two years, since most of the components have already been fabricated.

Robbie told Esquire PH that he has “worked with 13 Pritzker Prize architects, possibly more than any human being in the world.”

“I love doing this! It’s not just about the valuation. It’s [about] creating something so inherently different.”

We have intellectual property over all these names – you can get them at a ridiculously high price and wait a number of years, or get it from us in three months at a much cheaper price.

In a separate interview with CoBo, Robbie said that he has a penchant for “[working] with the best people in the world”.

Learning from the best is a “privilege” and he wants to “impart that to the world”, he added.

This sort of branded collaboration has been done before in retail, such as Rodarte for Target and Balmain for H&M, but it’s definitely a novel concept in homes and architectures.

According to an interview with Tech Wire Asia, such branding can help increase the development’s sale price compared to competitors who might have a superior location, and it also tends to sell faster.

By leveraging the star power of these big names, Revolution successfully drives up the value of his buildings and simultaneously eliminates the idea that prefabricated homes are ‘cheap’.

But beyond the high valuation, Robbie said that such branded collaborations are great because they churn out designs that are “inherently different.”

“I’ve been [linking up architects with different celebrities] for well over a decade already, so [I’ve] understood how we could enhance the liveability and saleability of a product,” he told Tech Wire Asia.

The value proposition of [Revolution] is that you can go to Lenny Kravitz – if you can – pay him a million dollars, wait two to three years of your life – or do it through me for an affordable price.

“We’re the only branded housing company in the world.”

He admitted that keeping prices low has been a challenge – to “[create] something couture at Zara prices, while still keeping to the DNA of the architects and designers, who are used to blowing through sky-high budgets.”

Not Your Regular Real Estate Company

According to Robbie, his startup is greatly inspired by Airbnb and he aims to disrupt the real estate industry through lower price points and its technological innovations.

He admires Airbnb’s simple model of having no land and zero inventory, a global footprint, and its ability to use technology in a disruptive way.

And that’s exactly what Robbie wants to achieve with his own company.

“We are the complete antithesis of the traditional real estate company. We cater to the world. We do not have to be site-specific, buy land, take out construction loans, or have inventory,” he told DealstreetAsia.

“Our highly differentiated business model provides the best in architectural design globally, at lower costs and shorter timelines, through the ingenious application of technological innovation.”

With tech as the very fiber of its DNA, Revolution uses advanced robotics to create the house in order to reduce the errors and speed up the process.

Unlike traditional players, it’s very low on capital expenditures as it doesn’t own land; it’s not forced to sell in particular sites (it ships homes globally); and it gets its cash flow in three months versus the typical three to four years’ turnover time for brick and mortar firms.

“I would like to believe we have fundamentally transformed the real estate/property development sector by introducing affordability, accessibility, simplicity, convenience, and sustainability to an otherwise intimidating, complicated and generally expensive industry,” he told Forbes

As of March 2017, the company has booked US$110 million in orders for real estate projects.

When asked what he thinks are the contributing factor(s) of his startup’s success, he said that it’s “predicated on addressing the most common pain points of home buyers – speed, quality, cost, design, and complexity of the process.”

“Our fabricators can complete the developments faster. A home can be completed in three months as opposed to the usual two years as most of the components have already been fabricated, ready for assembly at the job site.”

“Moreover, instead of wasting six months to a year on design, our clients can choose from the works of the most revered award-winning architects and artists.”

Essentially, we democratize access to branded design of living spaces by combining world-renowned designers with the latest advances in construction technology.

The “Ikea Of Homebuilding”

© Provided by Vulcan Post

Moving forward, Robbie said that he is confident that his startup will be the global leader in designer fabricated structures, and eventually be the “Ikea of homebuilding”.

Although its main markets lie in Southeast Asia, the startup is “making moves to penetrate the American, Middle-Eastern and European markets.”

By this year, it aims to have at least four to five offices within Southeast Asia.

Globally, they plan on having offices in 20 countries – UAE, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, USA, Mexico, UK, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.

“And the list just keeps on growing. Global domination is our end goal,” Robbie told DealStreetAsia.

Sharing a piece of advice to fellow entrepreneurs, Robbie said that the real problem with the local startup community is the “lack of funding“.

If you do not have access to capital in the Philippines, be resourceful and go abroad. There are other countries like Malaysia or Indonesia, where there are more early-stage VC funds than the Philippines. Go pitch to them.

“Passion is not enough; obsession is key. You have to be extremely ambitious. Believe in your vision and see it through. Giving up should never be an option,” he added.

During a recent discussion at the launch of the Management Master program in New Ventures Innovation (NVI) at Prasetiya Mulia University in Cilandak, South Jakarta, experts discussed what it took to build a startup.

Andy Zain, the managing director of venture capitalist Kejora Ventures, said aspiring entrepreneurs should first gain experience in the field. This, he explained, would build knowledge and expertise in a respective field, which would create solutions to problems in a more comprehensive way

""Someone with five or 10 years experience in a bank, for example, could discover the gaps in the process of loan obtainment for farmers in regional areas,"" Zain said, adding that the knowledge would better inform innovative solutions.

He further warned aspiring entrepreneurs not to get stuck in romanticizing a passion in pursuing business. The most important thing was to understand the core issue of a problem, Zain added.

""Indonesia is a huge country. Don't just solve little problems.""

Thinking too small can also undermine the quality of the resulting product, which in turn will prevent investors from providing funds, because startups often need external financial support to grow.

""You have to see what the market is,"" Zain said.

Meanwhile, Elga Yulwardian, the co-founder of platform customer engagement provider Ivosights, emphasized the need for building the right team, where the skill set of every member complimented to each other.

""Perhaps it's also important to search for a co-founder that can complete the company,"" Elga said.

Lisa Ayu, the co-founder of agricultural startup Lima Kilo, concluded the discussion by stressing the importance of maintaining a certain level of curiosity in solving problems.

""Once we have no more curiosity to solve something, then we're stuck. So it's important to always stay curious,"" Lisa said. (wng)"

The Jakarta Post/Nusa Dua, Bali

Policymakers and regulatory bodies must formulate regulations to make sure that the financial technology (fintech) sector complies with security standards as well as contributes to society's greater good.

That conclusion was reached by a group of panelists comprising Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) Chairman Thomas Lembong, Financial Services Authority (OJK) Board of Commissioners Chairman Wimboh Santoso as well as Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Agus Martowardojo -- who was not present during the event but had his statements read out by a BI representative -- during a discussion on fintech regulation during the Next Indonesian Unicorn International Summit on Thursday.

The summit was organized by the Indonesian Venture Capital and Startups Association (Amvesindo) and the Ministry of Communications and Information and held at the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Center in Nusa Dua, Bali, from May 9 to 10.

The first summit of its kind, which providing a communication platform for Indonesian digital start-up companies and international investors, attracted around 70 local start-ups and around 70 international venture capitalists -- from countries such as China, India, the United States and Singapore.

Throughout the summit, over 1,023 meetings took place between local businesses and foreign venture capitalists to explore cooperation opportunities.

The growing fintech sector comprises, among other things, people-to-people lending as well as crowdfunding platforms.

""Regulators and policymakers must understand how the digital economy works, so we can manage the risks associated with the fintech sector,"" Wimboh asserted.

He explained that the biggest risk for the fintech sector was that these companies, due to a lack of transparency, could create one-sided benefits at the expense of a wider public.

He added that fraud and financial failure remained the greatest risks, which could cause the wider public to suffer.

According to Thomas, policymakers tended to be slow in responding to the rapid changes in the digital economy.

""Therefore, regulators across the world have to constantly communicate with one another [to keep abreast of the latest trends in the fintech sector]. This is a lesson from the 2008 financial crisis, that a collapse of the banking system in one place would create a domino effect elsewhere,"" he said.

According to Wimboh, regulatory bodies and policymakers, including the OJK, could come up with relevant policies on the fintech sector by engaging with business players as well as other stakeholders. The regulations, however, needed to adhere to a number of principles, he added.

""The first principle is fairness, so the fintech companies would not abuse users. They must be transparent to their customers, so that by the time these customers decide to buy one of their products, the customers have already understood and assessed the risks brought by these products,"" Wimboh said.

He added that since investors also bore the risks in funding these fintech companies, the companies also had to be transparent to the investors, to allow the investors to hold them accountable for possible failures.

""For instance, people-to-people lending platforms must disclose not only their pricing mechanisms but also verify their borrowers' identity […] to guarantee their system's safety,"" he explained.

According to Wimboh, another important fintech regulatory principle was that policymakers should always bear in mind is that the sector must contribute to the improvement of society as a whole.

In his statement, read out by the BI representative, Agus, also acknowledged that the fintech sector could disrupt the labor market, thereby worsening socioeconomic inequality.

To avoid some of the negative and disruptive social impacts of the fintech sector, Agus suggested that conventional banks and fintech companies work together to find middle ground in their operations to create prosperity for the country.

Wimboh added that, while it would take some time for Indonesia to really synchronize its fintech regulations with those of the world, the country's government could start by discussing with its Southeast Asian counterparts first.

According to him, when regulated properly, the fintech sector could benefit society in a number of ways, especially in terms of financial inclusion.

""Indonesia is a scattered island country; fintech could help people in remote areas who can't access financial services and therefore are very poor. With the help of the internet, we can reach these people without having to be present physically in cities where they live,"" he said.

""Through fintech, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) could also benefit from crowdfunding mechanisms and [online] distribution channels,"" he explained further, adding that 70 percent of Indonesia's 50 million SMES were unable to get funds from conventional banks.

He said he believed fintech could help Indonesia absorb more people into the workforce through the SMEs, while helping the enterprises reach more customers through enhanced online presence.

Meanwhile, Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara said his ministry had taken a number of actions, including simplifying digital business registration procedures, to help local startups, including fintech, and make maximum social impact.

""For example, previously the ministry had 40 ministerial regulations [on digital business registration], and we have condensed them into only one regulation. Whereas previously the ministry had 35 types of [digital business] permits, we have condensed them into only five types,"" he explained on the sidelines of the summit.

""We have also shortened digital business registration processes and made them more efficient. For instance, instead of sending your product to our ministry's laboratory to be examined, you could do it in your own laboratory and send the results to us to be analyzed instead,"" he added.

According to Rudiantara, the procedural simplification has made digital business registration faster.

""If you started the process before 12 p.m., you would have your permit issued by late afternoon,"" he said.

He added that the ministry strove to shift its paradigm from being merely a digital economy regulator, but also to become a facilitator and accelerator as well.

According to him, the ministry fulfills its facilitator role by organizing platforms like this summit, catalyzing engagement between local startups and foreign investors."
246;755178344;20180511;2018;https://finance-commerce.com/2018/05/the-latest-hotel-pitch-bring-the-kids/;"During a six-month backpacking tour of Southeast Asia, Maximo and Sebastian Tuscano pit-stopped for four nights at the Andaman, a 178-room Luxury Collection resort on a lush bay in Langkawi, Malaysia. They marveled at the fauna in the surrounding rainforest — the flying lemurs, dusky leaf monkeys, more than 300 species of butterflies — and swam in the lagoon-style swimming pool. They hunted hermit crabs, helped a marine biologist feed specimens at an on-site coral nursery, and participated in pirate-themed games and crafts.

In all, it was the perfect way for Maximo and Sebastian, twin brothers, to celebrate their 4th birthday.

“I wanted the children to be stimulated and engaged. No video games or TV, please!” recalls Darcy Tuscano, one of their moms. And while they spent plenty of family time, “it was nice to be alone as a couple, knowing the kids were safe and having a blast without us.”

As family travel has evolved into a $500 billion industry, based on numbers from the Family Travel Association, properties are catering to their littlest guests in ways that reflect their locales, just as for adults. “Hotel kids’ clubs used to be windowless rooms with crayons,” says Julie Danziger, director of luxury travel services at Ovation Vacations, a travel agency based in New York. Now, she says, they’ve become interactive training grounds for budding global citizens.

Take L’Apogée Courchevel, a ritzy ski resort in the French Alps, where the Mini VIP 1850 club — named for the town’s altitude, in meters — offers perfume- and chocolate-making workshops for kids. Gleneagles, in Scotland’s Highlands, stocks a fleet of quarter-sized Land Rovers just for little ones. And at Chewton Glen in Hampshire, aspiring chefs can learn to bake cinnamon buns in the English countryside. Unlike Walt Disney Co. or Club Med SAS resorts, none of these properties are intended to solely (or even chiefly) appeal to families. For high-net-worth parents, that’s exactly the point.

“After 9/11, people weren’t willing to leave their kids at home anymore — they wanted to be with them,” says Melissa Rosenbloum, a luxury-travel designer at SmartFlyer. Family time became a priority for travelers, making it one for hotels, too.

A new spin on ‘family friendly

Today, 88 percent of parents say they’re likely to travel with their child or children in the coming year, according to the 2017 U.S. Family Travel Survey, a joint effort from the Family Travel Association and NYU’s Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. Seventy percent of the survey’s 1,599 respondents indicated that amenities for children were a key factor in deciding where to stay.

That’s true for Long Island-based Mozelle Goldstein, a nurse, mother of three, and one of Danziger’s clients. Kids’ clubs have driven several of her vacations, including one to the Breakers in Palm Beach, Florida, where her 4-year-old son built a teddy bear that still reminds him of the Sunshine State. “It made him feel like the vacation was for him, not that he was just tagging along with the adults,” she recalls.

The mere existence of a kids’ club can make seemingly non-family-friendly vacations work for both parent and child. Consider the Brando, a cluster of 35 villas on the private island of Tetiaroa, near Tahiti in French Polynesia. “Would you ever think to go to French Polynesia with your 6-year-old?” Rosenbloum muses. But with the resort’s Lagoon School—where kids can learn about life on an atoll through snorkeling, treasure hunts, and whale-watching excursions—somehow even an ultra-sexy bucket-list destination in the South Pacific becomes appropriate for tots.

Dollars and cents

The Brando’s Lagoon School costs about $81 per child per half-day session, pocket change for guests spending upward of $2,200 per night for a private pool villa. According to Danziger, guests can typically expect to pay $30 to $60 for half a day, or rarely more than $100 for full days, at kids’ clubs with daily rates. (Most cater to children aged 4 through 12.)

“It’s not a revenue play,” says Rosenbloum. “Hotels are doing this to compete. Otherwise, they’re not going to get business from the parents.”

Every Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton property now includes entry-level access to the kids’ club in the room rate, as does the Andaman in Langkawi. “If the kids are in the club, chances are the adults are spending money at the spa,” points out Danziger, who routinely books her clients at properties with complimentary kids clubs such as Nizuc Resort & Spa in Cancun, Mexico; Acqualina Resort, just north of Miami Beach, Fla.; and Banyan Tree Mayakoba in Mayakoba, Mexico.

Best brands for families

For companies with brand-wide initiatives, kids’ clubs don’t just drive demand. They also cement loyalty.

Hyatt was the earliest adopter. It introduced Camp Hyatt in the 1980s and revamped the program in 2009 in partnership with National Geographic Kids. Among the best examples of Camp Hyatt’s educational programming are the offerings at the new Park Hyatt St. Kitts, where children can take Zumba classes set to Caribbean soca music, learn about the St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network, or create their own petroglyph drawings on volcanic rocks.

At Andaz Mayakoba Resort Riviera Maya — a Hyatt property in Mexico — kids can learn to make piñatas and Huichol crafts, go on eco-themed boat tours, and even take Spanish lessons.

Four Seasons once shunted its Kids For All Seasons clubs into under-utilized hotel spaces, but Scott Taber, global senior vice president of rooms, says that this amenity has lately “become a very important part of the design and construction process.” The Mansion at the Four Seasons Orlando — effectively a kids-only castle — has a volcano that can be climbed and “erupts” with the touch of a button. Not every property has something so elaborate, but every Four Seasons is on board with the program in some fashion.

Newest on the scene is Ritz-Carlton’s Ritz Kids, which rolled out in December 2014. Its programming was developed in partnership with Jean-Michel Cousteau’s Ocean Futures Society. Sessions can include a class with a Bedouin falconry master at the Ritz-Carlton Ras Al Khaimah in the Al Wadi Desert outside Dubai, or coconut leaf weaving and educational walks through rice fields near Mandapa, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia.

“By learning from nature and taking influences from local culture, kids learn how to take care of themselves — eating healthy and where their food comes from — as well as the stars, insects, and nature,” says Mandapa General Manager Ana Henriques, who helped develop Mandapa Camp.

What comes next

Ultimately, says Danziger, millennial and Gen Z travelers are more willing than their parents to put kids’ needs and desires ahead of their own: “They think: ‘This is my kids’ trip, and if we make it amazing for them, we make it amazing for us.’” Even Aman, one of the most exclusive hotels in the world, will be getting on board. Amangiri, the brand’s remote hideaway in Canyon Point, is starting to offer paleontology-themed fossil hunts for guests aged 5 and up.

But, according to chief executive George Lucas, the decision to go public was made with its existing customers in mind.

Lucas suggests the IPO, set for June, meets demand from Raiz’s customers, who he says want to own a part of the platform they’re investing through.

Accordingly, he says: “Part of the offering is a priority offering for existing customers”.

Shares in Raiz Invest will be offered at $1.80, with an expected market capitalisation upon listing of $119 million.

Lucas also suggests that being listed will offer a little extra reassurance, and, according to the prospectus, $4 million of the funds will be directed towards meeting regulatory requirements.

“We were a company looking after people’s money, ASX compliance is not going to hurt from that point of view as it will give comfort to the people using the platform,” Lucas says.

Some $5 million is earmarked for a bold overseas expansion plan, starting in South East Asia. Lucas says Raiz is already moving ahead in Indonesia and funding a partnership in Malaysia too.

“It’s very early stages,” Lucas says, “but it’s already rolling”.

Of the rest of the funds expected to be raised, the prospectus says $2 million will go towards staff entitlements; Lucas himself is set to receive a one-off cash bonus of $1 million.

Just over $2 million is set aside for working capital, something Lucas feels is particularly important, giving Raiz the flexibility to continue working on its product.

“Because we’ve grown so quickly, we need to keep a certain amount of cash, and to keep improving the product and attracting customers for the Australian market,” he says.

The final $2 million will fund re-branding and advertising, something that feels particularly pertinent following the company’s very recent rebrand from the Acorns name.

It was only in April that the startup decoupled from its US partner, the original US Acorns brand, and US Acorns became a minority stakeholder. But, Lucas says, despite the timing, that change was unrelated to the IPO.

“We’ve always had the IPO in mind, and these things take time, but the rebranding and the IPO were not linked — the rebrand was only linked to the deal in the US,” he says.

The 11 startups are Cheers, Datanest, Duithape, Dana Bijak, Gandeng Tangan, Gringgo, Indogold, Manpro, Trukita, Periksa.ID, and Weston. Adopting the theme of “Tech for a Better Indonesia”, these startups present their technologies before hundreds of esteemed guests including investors, government, corporates, and media.

“With this ‘Tech for a Better Indonesia’ theme, we hope to motivate the younger generation to be more proavtive in contributing to the nation through technology. Through this Expo 2.0, we are introducing the eleven startups who are working in making Indonesia a better place. Continuing from the presentation, we hope the startups and guests could take on the conversation and work together. Let it be in partnership, investment, or other collaboration,” said Wesley Harjono, managing director of GK-PnP.

For three months, the eleven startups are provided with a number of resources from seed funding, workshops, mentoring sessions, media exposure, free coworking space, and connection to corporates. At the moment, GK-PnP is working closely with four corporate partners – Astra International, BNI, BTN, and Sinar Mas – with more to come.

There are currently eight pilot projects between the startups and corporates with more to come from the 18 ongoing discussions. “GK-PnP always uphold the spirit of collaboration. It is our goal to create an ecosystem where everyone plays an important role. Coporates as capital owner and users could sinergize with startups as the technology provider and innovator,” said Jupe Tan, managing partner of Plug and Play APAC.

The graduation of the eleven startups also mark the recruitment for GK-PnP Batch 3 Accelerator Program. Interested startups are encouraged to apply online before May 10. The program welcomes startups from various verticals, including but not limited to Fintech, Mobility, IoT, Food&Agriculture Tech, and Sustainability.

The program is also stage agnostics, meaning startups of any sizes, be it seed stage or later stage, are welcome to apply. “We want to make the application accessible to founders anywhere, so everything can be done online. Founders just have to fill a form and upload their pitch deck online,” added Harjono."
250;754728998;20180510;2018;http://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/Islamic_FinTech_Research_Adoption.php;"Islamic finance increasingly open to FinTech

Written by Peter Walker 10/05/18

Islamic financial institutions are focusing on FinTech and digital transformation, with more than 70 per cent viewing these as being highly or extremely important in strategic decisions.



The findings are from a survey of 103 managers by the General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (CIBAFI). Many banks in the Middle East and Africa are launching technology departments and forming joint ventures with FinTech firms, with almost 45 per cent of respondents planning to increase or launch digital branches in the future.



Technology-related risks are now the biggest perceived risks for banks in the region, meaning they must ramp up innovation and tackle how new developments adhere to Islamic finance principles, according to CIBAFI.



“The Islamic financial industry, which has seen little change since 1975, is suddenly undergoing enormous shifts that can be challenging for Islamic finance institutions to mitigate,” the research stated. “Crowdfunding, P2P and payments platforms will be a major focus in the medium term.”



Technology that improves the customer experience was seen as the most important, with more than a quarter of respondents indicating current or imminent use of automated financial advice tools such a robo-advisers.



Meanwhile, CIBAFI also revealed the results of its first Islamic insurance (takaful) survey, covering 55 institutions from 24 countries. It showed a mixed view on technology, with concerns more around operational efficiency rather than innovation.



Respondents noted difficulties in finding suitable investments in Islamic bonds and Sharia-compliant equities, with allocations often influenced by regulatory requirements. Takaful firms therefore intend to increase investments in areas such as property, primarily to seek higher yields.



InsureTech avenues may be limited by Shariah issues, particularly around smart contracts - lawyers are likely to argue that computer code cannot be legally binding - though it is likely that broadly similar issues would exist from the point of view of conventional law.



“Clearly business models, as opposed to technologies themselves, will raise issues of Shariah compliance,” the research explained. “For example, an apparently peer-to-peer model may be heavily dependent on being supported by conventional insurance; an on-demand model may raise questions about how potentially very short-term participants can properly be said to have any kind of ‘ownership’ of the risk pool.”



EY recently predicted that Sharia compliant FinTech could help attract 150 million new banking customers in the next three years alone, with several countries around the world looking to become hubs for such activity.



Bloomberg Intelligence analysis suggested Malaysia, the UK and Indonesia are leading in terms of the number of Islamic FinTech startups, but several Middle Eastern countries are not far behind.



In January, Bahraini banks created a consortium to back 15 FinTech firms in five years, and last year, the Dubai International Finance Centre launched the FinTech Hive accelerator with a similar aim. Both countries’ regulatory authorities have also collaborated on FinTech sandboxes.



Last March, crowdfunded property investment platform Yielders became the first Islamic FinTech to receive Financial Conduct Authority direct regulation, while the UK government also set up an Islamic Fintech Panel this January."

Despite this new-found domination, Grab has been struggling to cope with the demand – its fleet of 35,000 vehicles simply could not accommodate to the 600,000 requests it receives in a day.

Due to the poor infrastructure and limited public transport options in the Philippines, ride-hailing services have proven to be very popular among the locals.

Tapping on these gaps, a slew of ride-hailing service providers have emerged in a bid to ‘grab’ the market share.

Four New Services To Start This Month

Undeterred by Grab’s giant presence in the Philippines, five new players have jostled their way into the scene.

Hype Transport Systems Inc. and Ipara Technologies and Solutions Inc are just two of the five new entrants approved by the regulator since Grab agreed to take over Uber’s operations in the Southeast Asia.

Both startups plan to start services this month.

“This is the perfect time to enter the market. Commuters are realising how difficult it is to have Grab as their only option,” Paolo Libertad, chief operating officer of Ipara, told Bloomberg.

He added that Ipara will be adopting a similar strategy as Grab – it will suspend drivers who cancel trips, and will mask passengers’ destinations to prevent drivers from being selective.

Meanwhile, Hype promises that its fares will be at least 20 per cent lower than Grab.

It will charge users only for the distance traveled, without factoring in travel time. This is a huge plus, considering the capital’s congested road conditions.

Go Lag Inc. and Micab Systems Corp are two other approved new entrants planning to start operations before end-May.

On the other hand, Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc. has yet to reveal a target launch date.

New Players Vying For 7% Market Share

“The accreditation of new TNCs is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” said the PCC in a Rappler report.

The entry of these new players may also force the regulator to again raise the cap on ride-hailing services in Manila, which was just increased by 42 per cent in February to 65,000.

Hirna founder Coco Mauricio is reportedly lobbying the transport regulator to cap fares and limit the promotions and incentives that only Grab can afford to offer.

Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Go-Jek – the biggest remaining rival in the – has also set its eyes on the Philippines, according to the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

Increased travel, the rise of e-commerce and a change in working habits are three trends that will impact the real estate investment trust (REIT) market. This is the view of Chua I-Min, a trainer with SGX Academy, the education and training arm of the Singapore Exchange.

On the first trend, Chua believes that with more people travelling, there will be greater demand for hotels in the future, impacting hospitality-type REITs positively. “It’s more common now for people to go for short-term stays compared with a decade ago,” he said at the EdgeProp Focus event on investment options in real estate.

But Chua is not as worried about the impact of sharing economy models such as Airbnb on the global hotel industry. “It’s actually a very different target market,” he later tells EdgeProp in an interview. Business travellers and people who are used to staying at five-star hotels will not opt for Airbnb; it will attract only travellers from “a certain segment”, he says. In fact, business travellers make up a high proportion of demand for hotel stays, adds Chua.

Chua: Well-managed malls and those with clear themes will remain relevant amid e-commerce expansion (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge)

Noting government regulations, Chua says it is “not so straightforward” for Airbnb to disrupt the existing hospitality market. The Singapore government has always monitored the short-term rental market closely. In April, it launched a public feedback session on a new policy that will allow Airbnb-type rentals only if 80% of residents in the condominium development agree to it. The minimum lease period for short-term stays is now three months, a change from a minimum stay of six months last June. Also, two homeowners were recently fined $60,000 and jailed 12 weeks each for providing unauthorised short-term stays to guests on Airbnb.

On the second trend, Chua believes e-commerce will impact two kinds of REITs — industrial and retail. The demand for warehouse space will rise to support increased global e-commerce activity, he says in the interview. This has also changed the purpose of warehouses, from solely storage to one that includes automation — capabilities to sort, pick and pack goods, Chua explains. The National Trades Union Congress, for instance, is building a 2.8ha storage warehouse with Surbana Jurong — Temasek-owned infrastructure and urban development consultancy — that will automate the goods- sorting process. This is slated for completion in 2021.

253;753691686;20180507;2018;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/southeast-asia-e-commerce-startup-iprice-raises-4m-led-by-chat-app-lines-vc-arm/;"iPrice, a service that aggregates Southeast Asia’s e-commerce websites in a single destination, has pulled in new funding led by messaging app Line’s VC arm, Line Ventures.

The round is officially undisclosed, but TechCrunch understands from a source close to negotiations that it is worth around $4 million. Existing iPrice backers Cento Ventures (formerly known as Digital Media Partners) and Venturra Capital also took part in this round.

iPrice, which has its HQ in Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, previously raised a $4 million Series A in late 2016. Today’s investment takes the startup to $9.7 million raised overall.

The company was started in 2015 in response to the growing number of e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia, and in particular the increasing number of vertical-specific options. Even though there are some giants, such as Alibaba’s Lazada, the region has a number of smaller players that can struggle for visibility. iPrice was initially a coupon site, before pivoting into an aggregation model which essentially acts as a destination for shoppers to then go on and purchase items from e-commerce retailers.

In a way, it is much like flight booking sites — such as Skyscanner — which ask a customer where they want to go before scouring the web for the best travel deals. iPrice does this for e-commerce in Southeast Asia. It hopes that simplifying things through a single destination portal can make it the go-to online buying site for the region, which now has over 330 million internet users — more than the population of the U.S. — according to a recent report co-authored by Google.

iPrice on the web, although its mobile app and mobile browser version are more used

Today, iPrice claims to offer over 500 million SKUs across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. The company said that over 50 million people visited its site since December 2016, and this year alone it is aiming to grow to 150 million visitors.

The company said electronics has been a particular driver while, outside of working with e-commerce firms to drive business, it has developed a B2B business with media groups and brands, including Mediacorp in Singapore and Samsung in Indonesia, who pay to tailor its service. Last year, it developed an insightful report on the state of e-commerce in Southeast Asia.

The deal makes sense for Line Ventures because of the unique vantage point that iPrice occupies, while it also ties into parent company Line’s desire to go beyond being a messaging app and build out a mobile ecosystem. That’s seen it develop services such as food delivery, ride-hailing, payments and e-commerce, although it has struggled in the latter category. A relationship with iPrice might give it greater insight for future e-commerce ventures in Southeast Asia."
254;753047572;20180504;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/19528/blockchain/vexanium-a-decentralized-platform-is-disrupting-the-marketing-ecosystem/;"An innovative decentralized marketing ecosystem called VEXANIUM, which helps to cut costs and improve efficiency and transparency for commercial businesses, is being launched by Danny Baskara – a Southeast Asia based e-commerce pioneer and team.

Founder and CEO Danny Baskara previously built and sold Indonesia’s largest voucher and couponing platform Evoucher, which had more than 2 million active users. After 7 years of building Evoucher, he realized that Blockchain technology can solve the fundamental problems of this industry. The idea for the VEXANIUM ecosystem was born.

The blockchain-based ecosystem which VEXANIUM creates will solve the major pain points that this industry faces today. In Asia, many retailers use online marketing platforms such as Groupon, Dianping or Meituan to win new customers. Promo marketing strategies rely heavily on these platforms which provide substantial traffic and sales.

Reducing the Commissions with Loyalty Points

These platforms charge an average of 15% – 20% in commissions per transaction through a CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) or CPS (Cost Per Sale) structure. An increasing number of retailers struggle because these commissions together with the discounts offered represent too high a proportion of their margins. To protect margins, retailers often end up giving lackluster discounts that are neither attractive or comes with unrealistic terms.

Meanwhile, customers are often frustrated when trying to utilize a voucher or redeem their gift cards and coupons. Common issues include already utilized vouchers, expired coupons, misplacing them or difficulty to utilize due to unreasonable terms and conditions.

“By using the VEXANIUM platform, companies can create points in loyalty program applications in the form of digital tokens,”

said Danny Baskara.

“Typically such incentives are rewards to customers in Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) activity. The tokens can also be converted into coupons or points that can be used in corporate applications.”

A study conducted by GfK concluded that 49% of consumers would gladly switch brands for savings in the form of a coupon. In the retail market, South-East Asia and Indonesia, in particular, are some of the fastest growing markets globally, with the latter boasting a population of over 260 million people. The importance of vouchers and coupons for retailers to attract new customers in those regions is significant.

VEXANIUM will revolutionize this space by bringing the voucher and couponing industry on-chain. The VEXANIUM platform will also naturally serve existing blockchain businesses in their user acquisition, activation and retention. This makes it attractive for both businessmen, crypto-enthusiasts and ordinary users.

The VEX app features an integration with selected crypto exchanges in order to allow users to directly trade their VEX token balance on the exchange. Also, the VEX Exchange will allow consumers to trade vouchers among themselves and set their own prices. Customers will be able to store and redeem their voucher tokens via VEXANIUM app.

One game-changing use-case of the VEX Platform is the lucrative “airdrop” market. It will allow Blockchain companies to create airdrop campaigns for acquiring new customers and rewarding existing ones by using the VEX token.

“For companies that want to take advantage of the VEXANIUM platform and want to create digital tokens on their applications are required to purchase a large number of VEXANIUM digital tokens -VEX, because each transaction is using the VEX token. It’s part of VEXANIUM ecosystem,”

Danny states. This will be facilitated via the VEX web and mobile apps.

In an exciting move, the VEXANIUM marketplace plans to be fully functional and open to merchants and individual users in Indonesia by Q4 2018. The company will complete the establishment of the ecosystem by launching VEXchange and VEXplorer by Q2 2019. Merchants and enterprise users can create voucher tokens and start their marketing campaigns all seamlessly via the one-stop mobile app.

Launch in Malaysia, Vietnam, Korea, HK, Thailand and Dubai

The company plans to launch in other major cities in Asia, including Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City, Seoul, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Dubai in 2019. It will then expand to major business hubs outside of Asia in 2020.

VEXANIUM’s Co-founder Robin Jang is also the Co-founder of Coinone Indonesia, the major South Korea cryptocurrency exchange that just launched their Indonesia chapter recently. A number of industry leaders are already joining VEXANIUM as advisors, such as Jason Lamuda, the Co-founder of Groupon Indonesia, and Patrick Linden, Managing partner at RVP Venture Group.

It is pitched as the world’s first fully-operational online platform allowing content buyers to trade film and TV rights.

AllRites Marketplace has been in beta form since July last year and starts formally this month – between APOS, Miptv and the Cannes Film Festival – with some 17,000 hours of mainly Asian content. It has ambitions to expand to world scale.

AllRites was founded and is operated by Riaz Mehta, who spent 17 years at Australian tech firm KAZ Group, before founding Imagine Group, a producer of large-scale reality shows including “The Contender Asia,” and “The Biggest Loser Asia.” Former NBC Universal VP of channels, David Gunson serves as AllRites chief content officer.

“For content creators, whether they are a big film studio or an independent producer, the AllRites Marketplace provides a platform to find authenticated buyers. For content buyers, the platform provides a global catalogue, allowing them to search for content, find instant content rights availabilities and make offers for content rights all online,” the company said. Listing content on the platform is free of charge, and it is free to use for buyers. A fee is charged to sellers for completed transactions.

“My experience as a producer showed me that appointing a (conventional) distributor does not mean success. Rights get locked up for a long time, there is no minimum guarantee, long negotiating periods and fees of 30-40%. One time I had a distributor go bust,” Mehta told Variety. “My objective with AllRites Marketplace is to de-risk the monetization of content.”

With no listing fees, non-exclusive terms and low overheads, the online marketplace offers independent content owners no downside, Mehta says. For buyers, the site’s searchability, hosting of trailers and low-res episodes, and its payment gateway accelerate the process from selection to deal completion.

“We are not taking away existing relationships,” Mehta said. “But just because a show has been sold in 100 territories, doesn’t mean that there aren’t another 80 remaining.” Content owners which have listed product to date include IMG, Mediacorp Singapore, Silver Wolf International, MNC Indonesia, and New Films International. It reports signing deal memos with a further 50 companies at the recent Miptv market.

Riaz says he understands that the film and TV industries will take time for the online market to take off and be used for more than re-syndication of library content.

Further developments he would like to introduce include: other genres such as formats and live sports; expansion of the ecosystem into a social media channel; and use of blockchain technology to better manage rights and payments.

To date the company has been backed with seed capital form Singapore and Vietnam. In the coming months, Mehta aims to go to the private capital markets for series A funding.

“Asia is one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Its diversity offers opportunity to the hundreds of independent companies trading in Asian content,” said Mehta.

257;752825071;20180503;2018;http://www.legalbusinessonline.com/features/unicorn-nation/75734;"Indonesia’s technology sector is seeing explosive growth in both the number of companies and the amount of inbound investment. The country already has more than 1,700 start-ups, and four “unicorns,” or billion-dollar companies, and industry watchers are predicting there will be more. Unsurprisingly, this is also reshaping the work that corporate law firms are doing.

Until barely a few years ago, Indonesia was primarily attracting investment into more traditional industry sectors such as energy, mining and agriculture. But all that is changing rapidly, as consumer goods, and more importantly, technology, take centre stage. According to data from Dealogic, cross-border investment in technology in Indonesia hit $3 billion in 2017, up from just $128 million the year before. It was also the first time the technology sector became the top source of inbound investment into the country, which doubled last year to $6.8 billion.

Indonesia currently has a youthful population of more than 250 million people who own at least 100 million smartphones, says Reuters, and as a result, the country has seen a rapid growth in the number of start-ups trying to capitalize on this potential in a growing economy. Indonesia currently has four unicorns - companies that have reached $1 billion in valuation without tapping the stock markets - including ride-hailing company Go-Jek, travel site Traveloka, and marketplaces Bukalapak and Tokopedia.

The investment is coming from a variety of sources. There are Indonesian domestic conglomerates looking to get a piece of the action. Chinese technology companies are becoming serious investors – an Alibaba-led invested in Tokopedia, while Tencent injected capital into Go-Jek, Indonesia’s largest ride-hailing and e-commerce group. Additionally, there is increasing interest from large venture capital firms like KKR, which recently also snapped up a stake in Go-Jek.

Ahmed Jamal Assegaf, a partner at Indonesian law firm Lubis Ganie Surowidjojo, says that most investors today see Indonesia as an investment opportunity based on the explosive growth of e-commerce in the country. “As most people know, Indonesia has the world’s fourth largest population and is also the largest economy in Southeast Asia,” he says. “With internet users and smartphone use expanding rapidly, Indonesia will eventually become a leading mobile-first nation in the future. With that in mind Indonesia is becoming a very interesting target for investors and venture capitalists, especially in the e-commerce sector.”

Vik Tang, a partner with Herbert Smith Freehills, agrees. “Firstly, Indonesia has a large population, with a growing middle class, which serves as a good target market,” he says. “Second, the e-commerce and fintech sectors here developed rapidly in the last 18 to 24 months. This is due to the opportunities created by a large proportion of ""unbanked"" or ""under-banked"" citizens and high internet and mobile phone penetration. We are also increasingly seeing convergence between the fintech and e-commerce sectors, where innovative ways of providing credit are being introduced onto e-commerce platforms. The government is also broadly supportive as the fintech sector is seen as a means of promoting financial inclusion.”

IMPACT ON LEGAL WORK

With this rapid growth in the technology sector, it is no surprise that law firms have been an increasing number of technology sector clients. Says Fahrul Yusuf, a partner with Indonesian law firm SSEK: “The trend started at the beginning of 2014, but most of the clients we see are the technology companies themselves rather than VCs. We do a broad range of work for them, including mergers and acquisitions and the establishment of new companies. A lot of the advice they are after is often quite standard, mostly revolving around how to get the licenses they need, especially those related to payment solutions.”

His experience is not unique. “Parallel to the current growth of venture capital and tech-sector in Indonesia, our firm is definitely aware of the need for legal expertise and services from companies within this sector,” says Assegaf. “Therefore, we are seeing more and more clients in that segment, especially from financial technology, e-commerce, and application-based companies. In general, these companies tend to seek advice regarding the procedure to invest in Indonesia and the most possible and efficient scheme to conduct business in Indonesia.”

Meanwhile, Tang says his firm has been seeing more fintech-related work recently. “Clients are using technology in many creative ways,” he notes. “These clients are not just start-ups but also the established players in the financial services and telecommunications sectors. A number of them have come to us for advice on company incorporation and licensing. Data protection is another issue that keeps on coming up. We are also doing more transactional M&A work involving fintech players. The transactions are beginning to become larger and more complex as parties seek to consolidate their positions via inorganic growth.”

This shift in work doesn’t mean a huge shift in the skills required from lawyers, but they still see some subtle differences. “It is more or less the same with other regular corporate/commercial work, however when it comes to startups, the main issue is normally related around funding, which will surely impact on their budget for legal fees as well,” says Assegaf. “For this we have asked our lawyers to understand deeply not only the business but also to the technicalities of the business well in advance, and to work smarter, rather than harder, in order to provide the most efficient and cost-effective legal services.

Keeping on top of developments in the market and technology, plus an evolving regulatory framework, is increasingly important, says Tang. “We need lawyers who have sound analytical skills and excellent grasp of the various regulations at play. But they also have to be able to think out of the box to find creative solutions for our clients,” he says. Adds Yusuf: In general, the work that SSEK does for clients in the tech sector is not too different from the regular corporate and commercial work we do, but certain queries require that we really understand how the technology works. For example, we need to understand the logic behind what constitutes e-money or an e-wallet and what are the parameters, not because we want to avoid licensing, but because getting a license is so difficult right now and clients would still like to go ahead with their business without violating the licensing rules.”

HELPING CLIENTS

Of course, in this brave new world of Indonesian tech, where rules are still evolving, sometimes clients can find it difficult to execute on their plans, and this is where law firms come in to help. For Yusuf at SSEK, the main challenge involves getting licenses. “Many of the startups are focused on the innovative payments sector and the licenses in this particular sector are not the easiest to get, with no clear reason as to why,” he says. “Some people are speculating that the regulators are favouring local players over foreign investors, but we’ve never seen anything official in this regard. Given this, SSEK and our lawyers working with clients in the tech sector need to be more creative, such as whether we would recommend tapping an existing license held by a third party and whether that would be acceptable to the regulators.”

Tang at HSF says that one of the most important aspects of the firm’s work is to help our clients understand how to navigate the Indonesian market and its complex regulatory environment. “This involves explaining the legal system, how the regulations are interpreted, and the roles of the various supervisory authorities we have here. Some of the aspects may be different from what foreign investors and VC firms are used to encountering in other markets,” he says.

Meanwhile, Assegaf at LGS says that the challenges faced by most local start-ups are mainly related to funding for the company’s capital, and the obligations to comply with the relevant government regulations (such as fintech companies needing to follow the guidelines set by the country’s financial regulator, OJK), while the challenges faced by most foreign investors are the legal uncertainty on investment climate. “This is mainly because of the fact that there are several provisions on technology law that have not been regulated by the government,” he says. “For instance, there are several business activities on technology sector that have not been classified under the Negative Investment List (Presidential Regulation No. 44 of 2017) in Indonesia. However, in practice, there is limitation for foreign ownership on such business activities.”

Meanwhile, most venture capital firms experience similar challenges as the local start startups, which is the obligation to comply with OJK rules. “Venture capital firms need to possess a minimum financial soundness level based on the following two factors – productive-asset quality and profitability – as stipulated under OJK Circular Letter No. 7/SEOJK.05/2018,” he says, adding: “Our main goal is to protect our client to conduct their business effectively by giving advice regarding the best scheme for their investment; additionally, with our network we may also match them up with our other clients which may have interest in the business.”

FANTASTIC GROWTH

Indonesia as a country now already has four out of the seven unicorns is the ASEAN region, and is likely to have more than five by 2019, the country’s communications minister Rudiantara recently told Reuters. He added that healthcare and education are the most promising sectors to spawn new unicorns.

Under Indonesia’s constitution, the government has to spend a fifth of its annual budget on education, so even excluding private spending an app or startup only needed to get a small percentage of this “huge” potential, Rudiantara said. Indonesia’s state budget for education was 400 trillion rupiah ($29.50 billion) in 2017. Meanwhile, healthcare has a state budget of more than 100 trillion rupiah, he said.

The minister added that he wanted to help make it easier for unicorns to apply for initial public offerings in Indonesia, as Local regulations prevent listings before companies have made a profit for a number of years. “If necessary, I will go to the OJK to solve this issue,” he said, adding the government should no longer be just a regulator. “It’s an old model. The government has to be the facilitator.”

Lawyers are also greatly optimistic about the immediate future of the technology sector in Indonesia. “Our prediction would be that there will be fantastic growth in the number of startup companies all over Indonesia and we expect to see a continued growth in the next few years,” says Assegaf. “Indonesia is a window of opportunity for most venture capitalists, considering its economic growth, increasing number of the middle class, and a more digitally savvy generation. Due to this, the government has been preparing several new regulations to support the growth of investment climates, especially in the tech sector.”

“Besides continuing to help our client to conduct business effectively and help new prospective foreign investors to invest in our country, we will not be surprised if there will be works which may relate to blockchain and/or cryptocurrency,” Assegaf adds.

Meanwhile, Yusuf expects to see more M&A transactions in the technology sector, mainly because of Indonesia’s unicorn-dominated market. “There will be new startups coming, but we do not expect the number will be as high as in the past,” he says.

For Tang, the unifying theme in the past 12 to 18 months has been one of convergence. “Various players from different sectors are beginning to break down sector barriers to cooperate and – often at the same time – compete with each other,” he says. “Innovation and new business models do not only come from the start-ups, as the incumbents (such as banks and telcos) are also reacting fast to these technology-driven changes. We also think that the use and protection of data will become even more important. All these factors make our work very interesting, particularly for our younger lawyers who are highly motivated to develop new knowledge in this area, and we look forward to even more interesting work in the next few years.”

Indonesia's Go-Jek poised for imminent Southeast Asia expansion

By Ed Davies of Reuters

Indonesian ride-hailing and online payment company Go-Jek is set to announce its first expansion to another country in Southeast Asia soon, according to an internal company email seen by Reuters.

Go-Jek also plans to expand to three other Southeast Asian countries by the middle of this year, the email quoting Go-Jek Chief Executive Nadiem Makarim said.

News of the plans comes after Uber Technologies Inc agreed to sell its Southeast Asian business to regional rival Grab.

The industry’s first big consolidation in Southeast Asia, home to about 640 million people, could put pressure on Go-Jek, which is backed by Alphabet Inc’s Google and China’s Tencent Holdings.

Makarim described that Uber deal as a “great opportunity” because “fewer players means a smoother path to continued and deepened market leadership” for Go-Jek in Indonesia.

Ride-hailing companies throughout Asia have relied heavily on discounts and promotions, driving down profit margins and increasing pressure for sector consolidation.

Go-Jek, a play on the local word for motorbike taxis, has grown rapidly since the startup launched eight years ago in Indonesia, a county with a population of more than 250 million people.

Customers can get drivers to deliver everything from meals and to cleaners and hairdressers, via a smartphone app - helping it become a crucial workaround in cities such as Jakarta with some of the worst traffic in the world.

Makarim did not name the countries targeted for expansion in the email, but Go-Jek’s chief technology officer has previously said it aimed to set up operations in the Philippines this year.

“Preparations are well underway and within the next few weeks our first new country launch will be announced,” the email quoted Makarim as saying.

“This will be followed by three other countries in Southeast Asia by the middle of the year.”

Citing the financial and strategic backing of its local and global partners, he added: “We are confident that we have more than enough support to take one of the most amazing growth stories in the world from being an Indonesian phenomenon to a global one.”

Google, Singapore investor Temasek and China’s Meituan-Dianping are among investors in Go-Jek as part of a major fund-raising round.

Makarim said that a “significant portion” of capital raised has been set aside for international expansion."
258;752307757;20180501;2018;https://www.forest-trends.org/ecosystem_marketplace/how-indonesian-billionaire-uses-shadow-companies-to-clear-forest-for-palm-oil/;"The owner of Indonesia’s largest conglomerate has been accused of participating in the illegal deforestation of Borneo’s Ketungau peat swamp to make way for oil palm plantations.

The Salim Group, owned by tycoon Anthoni Salim, Indonesia’s fourth-richest man according to Forbes, is reportedly linked either by ownership or association with the two companies that cleared nearly 10,000 hectares of the protected rainforest.

The Salim Group notably includes Indofood, a joint-venture partner with major brands such as PepsiCo and Nestle, as well as First Pacific, the joint owner of Goodman Fielder, a leading food producer in the Asia-Pacific region.

In a new report released today, Aidenvironment, a sustainability consultancy, said that the Salim Group’s continuing reliance on “shadow companies” to sidestep legal oversight also raised questions over the complicity of major banks, such as Citibank, Mizuho, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas and Rabobank, that finance the Salim Group.

“This report provides clear evidence of shady business dealings and inaction at the highest levels of business, all while tropical rainforests continue to fall for Conflict Palm Oil,” said Gemma Tillack, forest policy director of Rainforest Action Network (RAN), which commissioned the research along with Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN) and SumOfUs.

The report, titled “Palm oil sustainability assessment of Salim-related companies in Borneo peat forests”, also alleged that The Salim Group was made aware of the deforestation carried out by PT Duta Rendra Mulya — majority owned by Anthoni Salim — and PT Sawit Khatulistiwa Lestari — linked with the tycoon through business associates — in early 2016, but failed to act despite repeated attempts at government intervention.

It found that one of the companies, PT Sawit Khatulistiwa Lestari, had successfully applied for a change to the government’s peatland moratorium map to allow development, despite almost all of the concession being categorized as “peatlands prioritized for protection.”

“The Salim Group’s financiers and business partners – like PepsiCo – are complicit in the illegal deforestation, as they continue to do business with Salim without issue. PepsiCo, Nestle and Wilmar must bring their business partner into compliance with Indonesian law and sustainability norms of deforestation-free development or exit their business relationships,” Tillack said in a statement.

The corporate structure of Salim’s conglomerate — a foundation of publicly listed companies with declared sustainability commitments and Salim Group-related shadow companies that allegedly continue to operate illegally — should be of serious concern to investors and business partners, the report argues.

“This isn’t the first time that companies in the Salim Group have been exposed for destructive practices,” Kiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace’s Indonesian forests campaign, said in the statement. “The Salim Group is one of the worst offenders and has gone out of its way to keep its destructive operations separate from the public face of the Indofood empire. That’s why companies need to take responsibility for ensuring that they only use palm oil from responsible producers that protect rainforests and respect human rights.”

The Salim Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Mongabay.

The Ketungau peat swamp in Indonesian Borneo’s Sintang district is subject to special protections under Indonesian law. Peat forests are at high risk of burning and are covered by specific rules as part of global climate regulations because they act as natural carbon storage areas. The annual CO2 emissions from the drained area of the Ketungau peatland will be equivalent to the annual emissions from 110,000 passenger vehicles, according to figures from the World Resources Institute.

According to new supply chain data analyzed by Greenpeace, major brands continue to do business with palm oil mills which are at high risk of sourcing from Salim Group-linked companies.

“Billions of dollars in corporate loans, and finance from bonds and shares, have all flowed to the Salim Group companies despite Mr Salim’s connection to ongoing illegal deforestation,” said Vemund Olsen from RFN. “Banks need to step up their commitments to climate change and stop bankrolling peat destruction.”

In response to the findings in the Aidenvironment report, Citigroup said it was cancelling all lending agreements with IndoAgri, the Salim Group’s agribusiness arm, effective immediately and conducting an investigation into its exposure to tainted palm oil through other lines of credit offered to Indofood.

Standard Chartered, HSBC, Rabobank and DBS said they remained committed to sustainable palm oil policies and would review lending arrangements where necessary. BNP Paribas and SMFG denied responsibility because PT Duta Rendra Mulya and PT Sawit Khatulistiwa Lestari are not their clients.

In 2016, The Salim Group was accused of being behind four companies that were at the forefront of illegal oil palm expansion in Indonesia’s Papua region, employing a complex network of shared directorships and offshore companies to obfuscate its responsibility.

Recent research by investigative blog awas MIFEE has also alleged that the Indogunta Group, a non-traditional corporate entity with numerous plantations in the Kalimantan and Papua regions, was controlled, through a series of beneficial ownership arrangements, by Salim.

Selwyn Moran of awas MIFEE said it was a challenge for the environmental movement to campaign against the financing of companies such as the Salim Group, which operate obscure supply chains.

“It is not just the Salim Group; most of the main palm oil groups have these ‘dark sides’ that continue to deforest,” he told Mongabay. “If trader and consumer companies genuinely want to commit to no-deforestation policies then they need to apply the principle of group-level responsibility to these groups where the ownership structure is obscure and there is a good reason to believe that there is a beneficial owner who is not on the shareholding list.”

“It should really be up to the trading companies to place the burden of proof on their suppliers to disprove the link with companies that deforest, especially if they are registered at the same address, as in the case of some of the Salim concessions.”

The Sierra Club called it “a historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay”.

But the consequences of US President Donald Trump’s expected decision to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris Climate Agreement depends on how the rest of the world responds – as Gus Silva-Chavez pointed out on the May 8 episode of the Bionic Planet podcast.

“Since [the 2016 climate talks in] Marrakesh, everyone has said on-the-record all the right things, which is: ‘If the US leaves, we’re moving forward,’” said Silva-Chavez, who oversees the Forest Trends REDDX carbon-financing tracking initiative. “But the biggest risk is: what happens if India says, ‘If they’re out, we’re out?’”

Then, he said, India could pull Brazil, South Africa, or other countries with them.

But if everyone stays and doubles down, he added, the Agreement could be stronger than ever.

Without the US at the table blocking progress or trying to re-negotiate the agreement, there may be hope. Rest of the world needs to lead. https://t.co/FXuFz0yQAf — Gus Silva-Chávez (@GusREDD) May 31, 2017

That’s because, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement isn’t a top-down, one-size-fits-all prescription, but rather a framework within which countries can reduce their emissions in the ways they see fit, and all can engage in a “race to the top”. By leaving, Silva-Chavez says, the country can’t gunk things up the way it did under George W Bush (see “Trump: At Least He’s Out of the Way”, below).

Since that interview, India and China have both won high marks for beating their pledges to date, even as the United States backslid.

Listen to the Podcast

For the full interview with Gus Silva-Chavez, listen to the May 8 edition of the Bionic Planet podcast on Bionic-Planet.com, or on iTunes, TuneIn, Stitcher, and pretty much anywhere you access podcasts.



Trump: At Least he’s Out of the Way

The following is reprinted from the May 8 edition of Ecosystem Marketplace:

The dark-haired man looked haggard and world-weary as he leaned towards the microphone.

“We ask for your leadership,” he told US Undersecretary of State Paula Dobriansky, with cameras running and the world watching.

“We seek your leadership,” he continued. “But if for some reason you’re not willing to lead, leave it to the rest of us. Please, get out of the way!”

The year was 2007, and the young man was Kevin Conrad, who represents Papua New Guinea in UN climate talks. The place was Bali, Indonesia, where George W Bush’s US negotiating team had been gunking up talks with silly games and doublespeak. The words perfectly captured the exasperation in the room, and delegates roared in rare applause. Bush’s team backed down.

But ten years on, it’s déjà vu all over again, except this time the world isn’t haggling over how to fix the climate mess. Instead, negotiators are meeting in Bonn, Germany this week and next to begin implementing the bottom-up fix that the world has already agreed on – a fix the United States was instrumental in creating: namely, the Paris Climate Agreement, which is a flexible framework that gives every country the leeway to meet the climate challenge as it sees fit.

It does require the creation of science-based rules for measuring and monitoring emissions, and the world’s media should be focused on the substantive efforts to develop a detailed rulebook for handling international cooperation on emission-reductions. Instead, however, the Trump Show has stolen the spotlight, and media is preoccupied with the question of whether Trump will or will not pull out of the landmark accord.

Most reports focus on the tragedy of him leaving, but some insiders fear the opposite: namely, that he’ll stay in and sabotage progress.

Gus Silva-Chavez is one of those. A longtime NGO observer, Silva-Chavez now runs the Forest Trends REDDX initiative, which tracks carbon finance – finance that depends on accurate measurements of greenhouse-gas emissions and reductions, as well as rigorous tracking of international carbon transfers.

It’s complicated stuff, but 99 percent of the work has already been done. Silva-Chavez, however, fears the Trump team will either complicate it even more or try to “streamline” it, which would undermine the environmental integrity of the system.

“They could go in and say, ‘The UN is not going to tell the US what to do,’” he says in an interview to appear on today’s episode of the Bionic Planet podcast. “They could say, ‘We don’t need an extensive, detailed rulebook. All we need are the basics, and we’re not going to agree to anything more.’”

That, he says, could slow the talks without formally appearing to do so, just as Republican strategists undermined civil rights while formally protecting “freedom”. Also, he adds, while the US stands alone now, any opposition could provide cover for other countries to also bail or stall.

“Right now, on the record, every country is saying the right thing: that they’ll toe the line,” he says. “But that could change if the US breaks its word.”

If that sounds far-fetched, we need just look back to the bad old days of the second Bush administration, which handed negotiations over to a previously unknown and famously unqualified congressional staffer named Harlan Watson.

The Triumvirate of Obstruction

Watson was a human wrench tossed into the gears of global diplomacy by ExxonMobil for the sole purpose of grinding those gears to a halt. For that task, we was actually well-suited, and his name elicits such visceral feelings of disgust among those who were there that it probably warrants a trigger warning. The parallels to today are frightening: ExxonMobil inserted Watson into the Bush administration via a fax “which Exxon Mobil spokesman Russ Roberts said was sent by the company but not written by any of its employees,” as Washington Post reporter Juliet Eilperin put it – foreshadowing the daily doublespeak that Sean Spicer now spews at every White House presser.

Watson, along with Dobriansky and energy industry lawyer James Connoughton, formed an unholy Triumvirate of Obstruction that neutered the US on the world stage, and as an example, you can look to Bali: after months of stalling and flip-flopping, Watson said the US would only sign an agreement without targets or numbers because “once numbers appear in the text, it prejudges the outcome and will tend to drive the negotiations in one direction.”

After another collective groan from delegates, it was former US Vice-President Al Gore’s turn to speak.

“My own country, the United States, is mainly responsible for obstructing progress at Bali,” he admitted, but “over the next two years the United States is going to be somewhere it is not now….One year and 40 days from today, there will be a new (presidential) inauguration in the United States.”

He argued that even a watered-down agreement was better than nothing, so delegates passed an agreement that met all of Watson’s criteria, but Dobriansky still rejected it, prompting Conrad’s famous, exasperated retort and Dobriansky’s about-face.

As we all know now, Barack Obama won the next election, and his team incrementally helped shepherd the talks that resulted in the Paris Agreement – an incredibly flexible approach to fixing the climate mess that encourages a race to the top instead of binding targets.

Optimists like former Dutch negotiator Jos Cozijnsen point out that, from a rational perspective, the United States has no reason to either leave or torpedo the agreement.

“It’s not rational… and this is not Kyoto,” says Cozijnsen, who now advises environmental NGOs, referencing the Kyoto Protocol. “You can’t block anything anymore, and there is no reason for the US to do so.”

The Trump team, however, isn’t rational, either; and while they can’t formally block, they can gunk things up. Or they can get out of the way."

Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Indonesia highlighted two issues in the field of digital economy at the 32nd ASEAN Summit held in Singapore.



The issues covered a level playing field aimed at reaching a balance as well as tax and custom tariffs during e-commerce transactions.



Minister of Trade Enggartiasto Lukita stated at the summit in Singapore on Saturday that in the midst of development, ASEAN member countries have agreed to intensify solidarity in the economic and trade fields.



""We are all preparing to enter the era of digital economy,"" he noted.



He also revealed that Indonesia had brought up two issues, including the notion that all parties involved in the ASEAN need to offer an equal, level playing field between conventional and digital businesses.



""As an illustration, from the perspective of taxes, they also need to be treated in the same way,"" he added.



The second issue, as earlier discussed by Indonesia with the World Trade Organization (WTO), is the application of customs and tax fees on goods and services offered through electronic commerce.



""They are not applying the moratorium, but we can agree to apply it on the transmission fees,"" he added.



During his meeting with Director General of the WTO in Argentina last year, Minister Lukita had discussed the possible application of voluntary customs fees for goods and services traded through electronic transactions and transmission. The practices will then be handed over to each country.



The goods and services mentioned will include e-books, digital music, accounting services, and architecture services.



Meanwhile, electronic transmission services will still be included in the moratorium, so no customs and tax fees will be imposed on them.



He further revealed that ASEAN member countries have yet to gain full understanding of the matter.



""Thailand had submitted its inquiries to us on the issue and that was what we had brought up with the WTO as well,"" he stated.



To this end, he expressed optimism that the ASEAN would be truly ready in entering the era of digital economy with a more matured preparation."

Earlier this month, the fashion elite gathered in Dubai for the first-ever Pret-A-Cover, a glamorous event during which designers from around the world showed off collections specifically targeted at Muslim women. Attendees saw models dressed in embroidered dresses, colorful chinoiserie prints, and flowing evening gowns. But upon closer inspection, the looks were less form-fitting than the ones you might find on the catwalks of New York or Milan. Most of the models sported some sort of head covering, although some did not. Pret-A-Cover was organized by the Islamic Fashion And Design Council (IFDC), a five-year-old organization founded by New York-based Alia Khan. The Council has offices around the world–from Russia to Turkey to Canada–and helps support a fashion industry that has risen to serve the Muslim market, which is currently driving a $254 billion industry worldwide. “When we launched, there was really nothing to support the industry,” she says. “It was a fragmented space. I found this surprising because it’s been the strongest, most in-demand category of fashion since Adam and Eve,” Khan claims. Pret-A-Cover was specifically geared toward drawing attention to emerging designers from around the world who are putting their own spin on modest dressing. After the brands flaunted their latest collections, they could enter a marketplace where corporate buyers from places like Harvey Nichols and The Modist (a luxury e-commerce site focused on modest fashion) might order merchandise for their stores. The event made it clear that Muslim clothing features a lot of diversity and color. Around the world, Muslim women adhere to different cultural norms when it comes to modesty. In places like Saudi Arabia, women are fully veiled. In Indonesia, there’s more variety; women choose different degrees of covering, and some skip it altogether, though still opting for looser-fitting body garments.

This variety was obvious in the design seen at Pret-A-Cover. Talabaya, a line designed by Czech designer Mirka Talavašková, is full of military-inspired details–think structured trench-coats and button-downs–but still manages to look feminine thanks to silky materials and pastel colors. Schmiley Mo, founded by Indonesian designer Diana Rikasari, is pure pop streetwear, all covered in emojis and cartoon designs. Blue Meets Blue, an evening wear couture lined designed by Chicago-based Shahd Alasaly, features glorious tulle and satin confections.

Click link on our bio to shop for your friends, sisters, nieces or daughters! ???? #SchmileyMoKids A post shared by Schmiley Mo (@schmileymo) on Apr 15, 2018 at 1:23am PDT Over the last few years, major fashion brands have been trying to tap into the lucrative market by creating Muslim-focused lines, often timed to come out in time for Ramadan, an important holiday in the Islamic tradition. Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY, and Mango have all released modest collections, and Macy’s announced in February that it will soon sell products just for Muslim women. While IFDC’s Khan favors offering Muslim women more fashion options, in her focus groups she found that most of the target audience was not thrilled with what these big-name brands were putting out. Often, these Muslim-specific lines were not as fashion forward as the lines those high-end brands offered non-Muslim customers. The clothing was often less colorful and interesting. Dolce & Gabbana’s collection, for instance, centered around the “abaya,” a cloak-like outer layer favored by many Muslim women. All the pieces were black and white and almost identical in silhouette. When these collections came out, Muslim fashion observers were not impressed. Dolce & Gabbana, Aaleen Zulquarnain wrote in HuffPo, “is repeatedly being hailed as ‘progressive’ and their announcement is supposedly an exciting development in the fashion realm, but for some Muslim women, there is nothing exceptional or remotely noteworthy about this line at all.” In the Guardian, Requais Haris wrote: “This range rather looks like an appropriation of existing traditions without giving them any real recognition.”

This supports what Khan has found in her own research on Muslim women. “Brands have tended to miss the mark,” Khan says. “They don’t understand that this audience is just as stylish and demanding of their fashion wardrobes as anybody else. What these women really want is the same miniskirt they saw on the runway, but slightly looser and longer.” To Khan, the big brands’ approach to Islamic fashion is symptomatic of a deeper lack of understanding about what makes Muslim women tick. “These brands prove to their audience that they haven’t done their due diligence,” Khan says. “In some cases, it was a bit offensive because we had feedback like, ‘I feel like they want me to wear my grandmother’s tablecloth because they’ve kind of pigeon-holed me into a certain image that they have of me that is absolutely not true.'” Getting It Right Khan feels many of the emerging designers who showed at Pret-A-Cover are more in tune with their target audience than fashion bigwigs like Burberry and DKNY. Designers like Blue Meets Blue’s Shahd Alasaly, for instance, are Muslim women themselves. Since Alasaly is based in Chicago, her tastes are also inflected with American culture and fashion. “I love the fact that there are so many more choices now,” says Khan. “Shahd, for instance, sees the abaya as just another piece of outerwear, not something uniquely Muslim. And she puts her own Chicago spin on it.” BlueMeetsBlue’s aesthetic lies at the intersection of luxury and modesty. Like other makers of high-end evening wear, a dress can cost as much as $1,250. But unlike competing brands, Alasaly’s designs are looser-fitting and provide more coverage. Since she launched three years ago, she’s been selling her clothes at trunk shows and pop-ups, as well as through her website.

While there are women of all backgrounds who favor more modest looks–orthodox Jewish women, for example–many of Alasaly’s clients are Muslim. Another big thing that sets Alasaly’s brand apart is her social mission: All her clothes are made by recent refugees to the U.S., many of whom hail from predominantly Muslim countries. Khan is encouraged by the talented batch of Muslim designers she is helping to promote. She wants to give Muslim women as many fashion options as possible, since they are currently profoundly underserved. Indeed, Khan hopes that these new designers help more famous Western designers better understand how to cater to the Muslim market. “There is a learning curve,” Khan says. “It’s not even a difficult learning curve, but I feel some some brands just didn’t bother to go through that process,” she emphasizes. Ultimately, it’s in the interest of fashion brands to make clothes that Muslim women want to buy. By 2030, Pew estimates that Muslims will make up more than a quarter of the world’s population. If you calculate the combined spending power of the global Muslim population today, it would be equal to the economy of the third-largest country in the world, after the U.S. and China.

Khan points out that Muslim women have some consistent needs that are relatively easy to accommodate and aren’t likely to evolve dramatically in the future. If a brand learns how to get modest fashion right, the long-term payoff could be enormous. “Businesses have a lot to gain,” Khan says. “Modesty is not a passing fancy for these women; it’s not going to be ‘in’ this year and ‘out’ the next. And there’s real spending power behind it.”"

Building on its effort to support the growing number of Startups focussing on building solutions to Solve for India and its local needs, Google India hosted a four day mentorship bootcamp for teams of ten Indian startups.

Speaking about the objective behind launching the programme, Karthik Padmanabhan, Developer Relations Lead, ‎Google India said, “ With this programme, our objective is to build a bridge between startups and the industry ecosystem and provide them with the right technology support and mentorship to help them succeed. We shortlisted 10 startups from 160 homegrown startups by traveling across 15 cities in India, and are now ready to scale this pilot as a dedicated program for India.”

Launched last year as an India-only pilot for mentorship and engagement by Google Developers Launchpad team, ‘Solve for India’ focusses on bringing the best of Google expertise across product, UX/UI and the latest technologies including machine learning and AI to help emerging startups that are focussing on building solutions that serves for India’s needs.

At the bootcamp, founders and their teams spent four days in one-on-one consults with experts from Google and external mentors from the industry to solve the critical product and growth challenges of the startups.

Speaking about the plans to scale the programme further, Paul Ravindranath G, Program Manager, Launchpad Accelerator, Google India, said, “Through the last ten months, we have focussed on building the right mentorship network to support the challenges faced by these startups. And we’re delighted to share that we will be expanding the mentoring support beyond this bootcamp, by launching a structured mentorship program for startups who are using machine learning and artificial intelligence to Solve for India, and run this as an ongoing effort”

Participating in the first bootcamp, were founders of startups, including Nebulaa, Slang Labs, PregBuddy, LegalDesk, PaySack, Vokal, FarMart, Meesho, Pratilipi and M-Indicator.

This is what one of the founders who participated in the programme had to say about Solve For India.

Subhadeep Mondal, Co-Founder and CEO, PregBuddy, said, “It was a great learning experience for us at the ‘Solve for India’ bootcamp. Our interactions with experts in the fields of product, technology, UI/UX and marketing, helped us getting the visibility around our product, customers and inbound partnerships. Our focused discussions and debates with mentors also helped us learn to build product strategies, improve sales process, make technology platform more efficient, and design for the next generation of internet users.”

Google is one of the myriad tech giants that’s closely watching the tech entrepreneurs in India and in the recent years, it claims to have witnessed an exponential growth in entrepreneurial and startup activity that goes beyond the big metros.

Paul also says that “We’re seeing a whole new generation of entrepreneurs and founders who’re innovating to solve for real challenges across Agriculture, Healthcare, Environment, Retail, Education, MicroFinance and the Indian language web.”

Google has been active in India through various programmes such as the Launchpad Accelerator and the Launchpad events, and it has developed a very local high touch engagement programme for a growing number of Indian startups that are building solutions to solve for critical challenges of India. Google had launched its accelerator programme by the name Launchpad Accelerator to provide mentorship, training and support to mobile startups in India, Brazil and Indonesia in 2015. Through the programme, Google had also provided up to $50K in equity-free funding. Google is not the first tech giant thats boosting the Indian startup ecosystem. Enterprise software company Oracle also has the Oracle Startup Cloud Accelerator Programme in India. UC Berkeley, in collaboration with startup incubator and makerspace IKP Eden, also launched a medtech accelerator in Bengaluru. Microsoft is also running a global Accelerator programme in India and it has also partnered with Accenture Ventures to support startups in the growth-stage that create solution for enterprise. With India being at the centre of attention, no doubt, startups are now increasingly gaining momentum to raise successful ventures. With tech companies like Google, that is coming up with India focussed programmes such as Solve for India, on the task to mentor Indian startups, not only the startups are in for a gain but also, India can now look forward to dissemination of information to nurture the ecosystem to move towards a positive growth."

SINGAPORE -- Homegrown mobility app Ryde takes a seat in Singapore's ride-hailing market May 2, hoping to carve out space for its pink and orange logo and prevent Grab's green trademark from covering the entire country.

The 3-year-old carpool app operator starts the ride-hailing service five days before Uber formally exits the market.

The new RydeX service will offer booking up to seven days in advance. And riders can expect to wait an average of 20 minutes for their booking to be completed. The platform has registered 5,000 drivers with the necessary license and plans to expand the fleet to 15,000 in three months. Once the pool of private drivers reaches critical mass, RydeX will add on-demand booking as well.

""It is a natural extension of what we have been trying,"" Terence Zou, founder and CEO of Ryde Technologies, told reporters Wednesday. ""With Uber's exit, it provided us the opportune time to accelerate our plan, to crystallize it and to go to the market faster."" Zou said ""a significant proportion"" of the 5,000 drivers came from Uber.

Zou established Ryde in 2015, providing a carpool matching service in Singapore and expanding later to Hong Kong and Malaysia. In Singapore, the platform has 400,000 registered users and 40,000 drivers. A Ryde executive said this is the first technology venture for Zou, a Harvard Business School graduate and former investment banker. The company has received funding from investors, whom Zou did not name.

Singapore-based Grab agreed in late March to take over Uber's Southeast Asian businesses, driving increasing concerns that the company may raise fares or adopt other monopolistic tactics.

Terence Zou, founder and CEO of Ryde, seeks sustainable competition rather than a ""burn and bleed"" battle for market share.

""The market share for the second player should be ... 20% to 25%,"" Zou said.

Ryde plans to lure drivers by taking a 10% commission from them, half of Grab's 20%. Passengers will pay 5% less than competitors, Zou said, thanks to ""cash-back"" incentives paid into the app's mobile wallet after each ride. The digital cash can be used to pay for the next ride.

The company will not attempt car leasing, which Uber and Grab used to increase their fleets. Ryde seeks an ""asset light"" approach to avoid heavy investment.

Zou said his company focuses on building the platform and devising innovative features. One unique option will let a passenger tip the driver directly from the mobile wallet, encouraging good service.

Ryde is the first in Singapore to fill the void created by Uber's exit. Go-Jek reportedly aims to enter the city-state as well, as online media source TechCrunch suggests the Indonesian rival is exploring a tie-up with ComfortDelGro, Singapore's largest taxi operator.

Zou appears unfazed by challenging Grab's empire. ""We are not afraid of competition ... [it] is good for everyone,"" he told reporters.

""The landscape is changing as we approach the next phase of the private hire,"" he said, stressing that it is time to introduce sustainable practices rather than fight for market share in a ""burn and bleed"" fashion.

To keep the market open, Zou called for regulations to block ride-hailing operators from using exclusive contracts that ""tie drivers to a particular platform.""

""This is very unfair to the driver, and it also creates a monopolistic situation,"" he said.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore issued measures designed to maintain an open market following Uber's departure, temporarily preventing Grab from raising prices after the merger or signing drivers to exclusive contracts."

As the Indonesian government continues to make serious efforts to attract startups to be listed at the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX), it will have to fight off a new trend in startup consolidation which may prove to be a preferred exit option for startups, according to MDI Ventures CEO Nicko Widjaja."
265;750248777;20180424;2018;http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fintech-disrupting-remittance-services;"Almost a year after being approved as a participant of Bank Negara Malaysia’s regulatory sandbox, remittance service provider MoneyMatch Sdn Bhd is now fully operational, with 5,000 registered users and RM50 million in transaction volume so far. The service boasts the lowest remittance fees in the market, making it easier for individuals to conduct transactions across borders.

Since its inception in 2015, MoneyMatch has aimed to disrupt the services offered by banks and traditional money service businesses (MSB) by significantly lowering the cost required to remit funds and exchange currencies. Apart from the low transaction fees, it offers foreign exchange (FX) rates that are better than any bank counter rates in the country, says MoneyMatch co-founder Naysan Munusamy.

“Traditionally, one would have to pay almost RM100 in fees to send RM15,000 to Australia, which is about 3% to 4% of the transaction amount. In some countries, such as South Korea and the UK, the fee is a lot higher. It can cost up to 7%,” he says.

“Our rates are 10 to 12 times cheaper. For example, we charge a flat rate of RM8 to send money to Australia, inclusive of all charges, including the bank beneficiary charges.”

There are various reasons why MoneyMatch is able to offer a cheaper service, says Naysan. The first is low operational costs. As the company is fully digital, it does not need many offices and hundreds of full-time employees. Once these costs have been stripped out, the company is able to offer attractive rates to customers without jeopardising the day-to-day back-end operations.

On top of its multiple disbursement methods, MoneyMatch also works with a vast number of trading partners globally, executing peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges on a business-to-business basis. Naysan explains that the more inbound and outbound flows the company is able to match, the lower the cost charged to customers.

“We are also integrating with blockchain networks such as Ripple and Stellar. Hopefully, this will help us drive the cost even further down,” he says.

MoneyMatch CEO Adrian Yap has set an ambitious goal for the company — to be Malaysia’s first full-fledged digital bank in the next three to five years. According to him, this could be a reality in the near future with the help of proper partners and financing, especially since Bank Negara has been very supportive of financial technology (fintech) and innovation.

“The vision that we have for a digital bank differs greatly from what is available right now. We would use artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to provide users with customised pricing for financial products. We are also waiting for certain advancements in blockchain technology that will enable us to securely build a scalable platform in a more robust and efficient way,” says Yap.

Cheaper and faster

MoneyMatch has the ability to fully onboard customers digitally with its proprietary e-Know Your Customer (e-KYC) protocol. Upon registering, users have to book an e-KYC call, which takes about a minute without any connection problems. During this call, the company’s compliance officer asks users several questions, including their source of income and purpose for sending money.

“We have to ask these questions to prevent money laundering or terrorism financing. On the back-end, we also do our checks with credit reporting agencies and global databases to ensure that the user is not a highly risky politically exposed person (PEP). Upon verification, users can freely send money to all the countries we cover,” says Naysan.

To send money, users are required to either go to MoneyMatch’s website or use its mobile app, set up a beneficiary bank account and approve the FX rate offered by the service provider. The website or app automatically connects to Bank Negara’s PayNet, which opens up the Financial Process Exchange (FPX) portal, which allows immediate and direct crediting into MoneyMatch’s account by banks.

MoneyMatch’s average ticket size at RM10,000 differs greatly from the national average of RM1,200. This is because unlike traditional MSBs in the country, the company does not target the lower-income population of foreign workers. Instead, the service is aimed at the lower-middle-income group and above.

“Our typical target user is like our chairman and investor, Azran Osman-Rani. He is a busy man, flying to destinations such as New York, London and Singapore. Recently, his son enrolled in Trinity College Melbourne, so he has to pay the tuition fees and give his son a monthly allowance. He will need to use the service a lot. This is the kind of users we have on our platform,” says Naysan.

The speed of the remittance depends on the countries, but it will not take longer than two days, he says. Today, MoneyMatch remits funds to 56 countries and plans to cover 90% of the world by the third quarter of this year. It also plans to expand its operations in two countries this year, one of which is Australia, due to the high number of Malaysian students and immigrants residing in the country.

“Malaysia as a country has a very high number of students overseas. There are about 20,000 per intake. Of this, 60% to 70% go to Australia, followed by the UK, Europe, the US, Indonesia and India. Typically, for students in Australia, the parents send a lump sum — probably about A$5,000 every few months to avoid constantly paying high transaction fees. With MoneyMatch, they can send money every now and then because it only costs them RM8 per transaction,” says Naysan.

There is also a high number of Malaysians working in Australia who send money back home, he adds. He is hopeful that after the company gets the appropriate operating licences in the country, MoneyMatch would be able to cut the waiting time and process remittances within five minutes (during their banks’ operating hours) at the cheapest rate possible.

Expansion plans

Going forward, there are a lot of services that the company would like to offer. For starters, it recently launched MoneyMatch Exchange, which allows users travelling to Singapore to exchange cash at the airport.

According to Naysan, there is a heavy volume of business travellers going between Malaysia and Singapore. These trips are typically less than three days, so they do not need to exchange more than S$1,000 at a time.

With MoneyMatch Exchange, users can book cash exchanges ahead of time at the rate offered by MSBs. Once users reach the airport, MoneyMatch’s full-time employee will meet them directly and perform counterfeit detection with a mobile device before providing the users with the exchange of cash. There is a RM10 convenience fee charged for the transaction."

The movement, called ""Ayo UMKM Jualan Online"" (Let SMEs Sell Online), is aimed at attracting and persuading SMEs across Indonesia to sell products via online marketplaces to increase profits and prosperity.

The government bodies that have taken part in the campaign include the Communications and Information Ministry, the Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry and the Creative Economy Agency (Bekraf).

Online marketplaces involved include Blibli.com, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Shopee, Lazada and Blanja.com.

Through the campaign, the government has set the goal of seeing 8 million SMEs go online by 2020, Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry marketing service director Emilia Suhaemi said.

""SMEs have proven to be the backbone of the Indonesian economy, by contributing 62.5 percent to Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP).

Image: Nishant Ratnakar for Forbes India



A few years ago, Govind Nair, then a sales consultant with the personal care products maker Colgate-Palmolive, was caught in the egregious traffic snarl that India’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, has become infamous for. He had thought little of the problem that day and underestimated the commute time to the airport from Electronic City, an IT hub.



As his chances of making it to the airport on time dimmed, a distressed Govind dialled his father KNG Nair and informed him of his misery. In jest, he added that Nair, who operated the Kerala-based helicopter charter service company Thumby Aviation Private Ltd, should send a chopper to airlift him. While the plea didn’t quite yield results, and Govind missed his flight, the wearying experience gave the father-son duo the germ of a business idea.



The idea took wings on March 6 this year as Thumby Aviation’s (and also India’s) maiden heli-taxi took off from Electronic City and landed at the helipad in Kempegowda International Airport (KIAL), flying over serpentine snarls and covering the 65 kilometre distance in under 30 minutes.



The company’s heli-taxi service is now a daily affair. It currently shuttles just one helicopter, a US-made six-seater Bell 407, with services being offered every half hour during two shifts: The first one between 6 am and 9.30 am and the second between 3.30 pm and 6 pm. A one-way seat on the chopper costs ₹3,500, excluding the 18 percent goods and services tax.



“It costs anywhere between ₹1,500 and ₹2,500 to hire a cab between Electronic City and the airport,” Govind, 29, tells Forbes India. “If you choose the luxury cabs offered by Uber or Ola, it costs even more. Cabs booked from hotels cost ₹3,500. So we have priced it reasonably and it takes less than half-an-hour, compared with two hours by road.”



For now, the bookings are being made through the in-house app HeliTaxii available for Android and iOS devices and the company is offering discounted fares for corporate bookings. The app has been downloaded over 13,000 times and so far, the response has been positive: Thumby Aviation flew over 90 people in the first two weeks. “We are operating the services [only] during peak hours now. Eventually, we want to take up more services and deploy bigger helicopters,” says Govind.



Thumby Aviation is the brainchild of KNG Nair. In 1998, shortly after quitting as a Group Captain in the Indian Air Force, where he had clocked over 13,500 hours of flying, KNG Nair joined the private sector. He began by flying helicopters for companies engaged in offshore oil drilling.



By 2004, Nair founded King Rotors & Air Charter Pvt Ltd while working with private companies such as Global Vectra as their chief pilot. King Rotors mainly focussed on private contracts, particularly from travel and tourism and the offshore sector. Nair floated the Thiruvananthapuram-based Thumby Aviation in 2009, with a specific focus on flying choppers over the often-inaccessible terrain of India’s northeastern states.



Thumby (Malayalam for dragonfly) soon expanded to Telangana, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh, finding clients in police, corporates and political parties who hired the services during election campaigns. By 2015, it emerged as one of the most formidable helicopter charter companies in India. “But, it was over the past 2-3 years that we decided to scale up and started exploring the commercial space,” says Govind, who is now head of business development at Thumby Aviation.



Soon after his ordeal of commuting from Electronic City to the airport, the company had set in process a plan to explore the opportunity in heli-taxi services. Employees spent almost a year interviewing people and researching, to assess the potential for a heli-taxi service in Bengaluru.



“We found that on an average, people spent over two hours to reach the airport and there are over 60,000 people who use the airport a day,” says Govind. Around the same time, the company was also offering joyrides on their helicopters in Hyderabad for ₹3,500 and it had found many takers.

“That’s when we realised we have a pain point which can be easily fixed,” says Govind. “For a long time, we had focussed only on the business-to-business segment. Now we want to scale up the business to the consumer space too.”





Thumby Aviation’s heli-taxi service is available every 30 minutes in two shifts

So far, Govind says the customers of the heli-taxi can be categorised into two groups—families, or those travelling to catch a flight or to receive someone at the airport, and corporates along with a fair share of foreigners.Circumventing road traffic by flying over it has already been successfully implemented in Brazil and Indonesia, though it is a new concept in India, which currently has just about 284 helicopters being used in civil aviation. The American multinational conglomerate Honeywell has suggested that demand from Asia’s third-largest economy for helicopters isn’t expected to rise significantly.This is in sharp contrast to the country’s aviation sector as a whole, which is buzzing with activity. India is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world with the domestic sector growing over 17 percent annually and requiring over 1,600 aircraft in the next 20 years, compared with nearly 500 aircraft currently, according to aircraft maker Airbus.So, will India’s new-found love for flying spill over to heli-taxis services? “Heli-taxis as a concept isn’t something new. They have existed from the 1950s in the US,” says Mark Martin, founder of Dubai-based Martin Consulting. “But in India, I see this having a huge potential and catching on like wildfire. That’s because each mode of transportation serves a purpose and here the purpose is to save time. It’s not that helicopters are uber luxurious. But if it [heli-taxi] can beat the traffic and save so much time, it is worth it. I would think this has a potential across India.”Meanwhile, Thumby Aviation, a zero-debt company with an authorised share capital of ₹5 crore and owned by KNG Nair and his wife, has set its ambitions fairly high. Over the next few months, the company wants to increase its network in Bengaluru and also begin operations at night, while also connecting more helipads. Post that, the company also wants to begin services in other Indian cities, including New Delhi and Mumbai.Alongside, it is also initiating talks with airlines and online travel agencies for a possible tie-up. “We have expanded our business mostly on profit accruals,” says Govind. “Now we see a big potential in the business, particularly with the response we have received so far. We want to go pan-India soon.” Clearly, he has a bird’s eye view of the future."

Singapore

CAUGHT in a raging battle between Chinese tech behemoths Tencent and Alibaba, Singapore-based Giosis, which operates Qoo10, is not going down without a fight after acquiring a hefty war chest from the sale of its Japanese business to eBay.

""We are much more ready in terms of cash, and our focus will also be only one - Singapore,"" Qoo10 Singapore's country manager Cho Hyun Wook told The Business Timesin an exclusive interview.

eBay announced in February that it will be acquiring Giosis' Japanese assets, including the Qoo10.jp platform, for an undisclosed amount. As part of the deal, eBay said it would give up its stake in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses.

sentifi.com Market voices on:

Industry figures put the value of the sale at about US$700 million, which is set to close this month.

Mr Cho said that after the sale, Qoo10 will spend 80 per cent of its total budget on the Singapore market. Other than Singapore, Qoo10 now runs marketplaces in Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and China.

The choice of Singapore may be surprising to some, given that Singapore has a relatively smaller market size, which Mr Cho acknowledged.

He revealed, however, that many global brands have told him Singapore is their fourth largest market in Asia, after China, Korea and Japan.

""Though the market might be the largest in Indonesia due to population size, it is actually not very meaningful to global brands, because it is fragmented into many areas,"" he said.

""But in Singapore, they see meaningful growth... It might be the only country they can see the ROIs (return on investments) in South-east Asia.""

A closer look at Qoo10's gross merchandise value (GMV) - the total sales dollar value for merchandise sold on the platform - provides further insight.

BT reported earlier that Qoo10 targeted US$1.2 billion in GMV last year. Mr Cho said that before the sale, Japan was the largest contributor, providing 50 per cent of GMV, while Singapore was the next largest with 40 per cent.

Without Japan, Singapore now becomes the dominant contributor with 80 per cent of GMV.

Mr Cho admitted that the company wanted to hold on to Japan, but had to make a choice because of costly ""money games"" in the region.

He explained that if they could develop a sophisticated platform in Singapore, they could then replicate, recombine and export this platform to other South-east Asian countries.

Both Tencent and Alibaba have taken a keen interest in Qoo10's Singapore-based rivals, carving them into two separate factions, as they vie for dominance in South-east Asia.

Tencent began investing in Sea, which runs Shopee, since 2013. By the time Sea was publicly launched on the New York Stock Exchange last October, Tencent had a near 40 per cent stake.

Alibaba acquired control of Lazada in 2016 with an investment of US$1 billion. With that injection of funds, Lazada acquired RedMart, a grocery-focused e-marketplace.

Last year, Alibaba pumped a further US$1 billion into Lazada to up its stake to 83 per cent, and another US$2 billion last month, bringing its total investment in Lazada to US$4 billion.

BT understands that Qoo10 is unlikely to seek any investments from either of the Chinese tech giants for now.

Nevertheless, it is still the most-visited e-marketplace site in Singapore, with more than 13.4 million monthly visits in Q1 2018, according to meta-search website iPrice. This was over 3 million visits more than nearest rival, Lazada.

Qoo10 saw a 15 per cent year-on-year growth in GMV last year, but only a 10 per cent increase in the number of transactions, which Mr Cho attributed to the growth of the digital category.

The digital category, where products could cost thousands of dollars, has been the top category contributor in terms of GMV. But he said this category was price-driven, meaning it led to loss-leading products and unsustainable price wars.

""All the competitors I see want to make their GMVs look nice, by focusing on digital products, but that is the easiest way to kill themselves.

""We will focus more on the beauty and fashion categories where the customers do not just look for price only... they look for style, stories and content.""

Qoo10 will also be adopting different strategies to compete more on a non-price basis.

Mr Cho said the company is actively engaging local brick-and-mortar merchants to further expand its product offerings, which currently stand at over 10 million. If there are not enough local merchants, Qoo10 will bring in merchants from other countries.

Qoo10 is also looking to shorten delivery time. Last year, it introduced a quick delivery option, promising a three-hour timeframe. Now, it is in talks with 7-Eleven to allow customers to pick up items at the chain's stores.

The company is moving into a 21,810 sq ft office at Gateway West next month, more than double the area it now occupies at Tampines Plaza. Qoo10 said it expects to increase its staff size by 30 per cent this year.

Adrian Lee, research director at Gartner, said: ""They have the merchant base, the inventory and fulfullment networks. Now, it is about how they improve and overhaul the user experience - they could be one of the biggest success stories if they get it right."""

270;749254798;20180420;2018;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/Startup_and_IT/30343554;"On Wednesday, the police questioned Facebook Indonesia public policy head Ruben Hattari at the force’s headquarters, in their first attempt to shed light on the case. It remains unclear, however, if the ongoing probe could ever lead to criminal charges against Facebook or its representatives here.

Below is what we know so far about the Facebook scandal in Indonesia:

What is the data-breach scandal about?

The Facebook data-breach scandal refers to the data harvesting by a third party, political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica (CA). CA harvested data and used it for marketing or political campaigning, allegedly helping US President Donald Trump win his presidency. CA was also contracted by one of Indonesia’s major political parties in 1999. While Facebook also harvests its users’ data and monetizes the data to run advertisements on its platform, Facebook does not sell the data to advertisers, as confirmed by founder Mark Zuckerberg during a recent US Congress hearing on the matter.

CA managed to harvest the data through two University of Cambridge academics, Aleksandr Kogan and Michal Kosinski. Kogan initially created “This is Your Digital Life” for research purposes, the personality test app was downloaded by 270,000 people but also collected the data of the downloaders’ friends, boosting this number to 87 million users, 1 million of whom were Indonesians.

This is why the Facebook-CA data breach is scandalous: Kogan’s app collected users’ data without their permission and the data was improperly sold to a third party.

How big is Facebook in Indonesia?

As quoted by Kompas.com, Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of Facebook users in the world. As of January, there were 130 million accounts on the social network, or 6 percent of the total global users. The cities with the most active users in Indonesia are Bekasi in West Java with 18 million accounts and Jakarta with 16 million accounts. This makes Indonesia the country with the most Facebook users in Southeast Asia.

How influential is Facebook in Indonesian elections?

Social media was largely to blame for polarizing Indonesians during the 2014 presidential election and the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, with Facebook and Twitter being the biggest platforms and therefore most influential. However, this had more to do with hoaxes and hate speech than data harvesting.

Some politicians have admitted to relying on social-media data for their campaigns, but it is unclear how sophisticated and widespread their use of social media data has been.

Conversations regarding the elections dominated the Facebook and Twitter news feed in 2014 and peaked in 2016. Since late 2017, the National Police have caught two syndicates allegedly responsible for creating and spreading hoaxes and inciting hate speech, Saracen and the Muslim Cyber Army.

Both groups, which used fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter in their operations, were critical of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and may have been organized to undermine him ahead of the 2019 presidential election.

Do the police have a strong case against Facebook Indonesia?

At this point, the answer is no. The investigation is still in its preliminary stage.

Ruben confirmed that Wednesday’s questioning by the police revolved around the alleged data breach, but stopped short of confirming whether he was questioned in an investigation of a criminal case built by the police.

National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto declined to disclose details of the questioning, and instead complained about the lack of cooperation on Facebook’s side in combating radical content on the social-media site.

On Thursday, National Police chief detective Comr. Gen. Ari Dono Sumanto made it clear the police were still investigating whether there was a crime in the data-breach scandal. He admitted that they had not found a single person claiming to have suffered losses from the data breach, or even claimed to have had their data stolen.

What are the possible charges against Facebook?

Data privacy is uncharted territory in Indonesia. There is no data protection law in the country, although a bill is expected to be passed this year. The bill has been in the 2015-2019 Prolegnas since 2016, but there has been no progress in the deliberation of the draft law.

The closest thing to data privacy protection is Communications and Information Ministerial Regulation No. 20/2016, but there is only a series of administrative penalties for individuals accused of misusing personal data harvested online. The regulation has no stipulation regarding penalties for corporations accused of stealing personal information.

The 2008 Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law, which is focused on curbing hate speech and hoaxes, does not specifically cover personal data protection.

A member of staff at the Communications and Information Ministry, however, has claimed that the ITE law could still be used to press charges against Facebook.

Article 26 of the law stipulates that “the use of electronic information on an individual’s personal data should be approved by the said individual.” Article 30 of the law further states that “illegally accessing information belonging to other people” is punishable by eight years’ imprisonment.

Human rights activist Wahyudi Jafar says that Facebook could be charged with interception as stipulated in Article 31 of the amended ITE law. The crime is punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment or a Rp 5 billion (US$362,287) fine.

“But it won’t be easy to prove this,” he says."

There is a growing appetite in particular for its advanced surveillance systems, the latest example being a body-mounted camera being used by Malaysian police that employs facial recognition technology to identify suspects.

The Auxiliary Force (AFSB), part of the Royal Malaysia Police Cooperative, has been equipping its officers with the cameras that use cutting-edge facial recognition capabilities designed by the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up Yitu Technology. The system enables officers to promptly compare and match images captured by the body-camera with those stored in the police database.

The surveillance camera works at night but, for now, only allows officers to review captured video footage to identify people of interest after the event.

“This is a significant step forward for us as we leverage artificial intelligence to increase public safety and security. Looking ahead, AFSB also intends to expand the capabilities of our body-worn camera system to include real-time facial recognition and instant alerts to the presence of persons of interest from criminal watch lists,” said Dato’ Rosmadi Bin Ghazali, CEO of the Auxiliary Force, in a press release.

How artificial intelligence will change the face of security in China

China is home to a number of leading AI companies, including SenseTime Group, Megvii – also known as Face++ – and Yitu Technology. The country accounted for 48 per cent of the total US$15.2 billion raised by AI start-ups worldwide last year, outstripping the 38 per cent raised by US firms, according to American research firm CB Insights.

Chinese city’s idea to deter jaywalkers – spray them with water

The world’s most populous country is also en route to creating a national facial recognition system that would be connected to cameras, with the ability to recognise any of the country’s 1.3 billion citizens in less than three seconds.

Founded in 2012, the Shanghai-based start-up Yitu, which completed series C funding of US$55 million in May 2017 from Hillhouse Capital Group and other investors, said three seconds is all it takes to identify someone from the 1.4 billion faces stored in China’s national databases.

This is a significant step forward for us as we leverage artificial intelligence to increase public safety and security

Dato’ Rosmadi Bin Ghazali, Auxiliary Force

Public security agencies have been the major source of demand for Yitu’s technology so far, Lin Chenxi, one of the two co-founders said in an interview in November.

Chinese public toilets go hi-tech with Wi-fi and facial recognition

Yitu’s facial recognition software has been widely used for safety and surveillance purposes in China. It is used by banks to verify ATM transactions, while surveillance cameras at borders are using it to match and cross-reference travellers with national databases to identify smugglers and illegal entrants.

Five Chinese start-ups making facial recognition a part of daily life

The solution from Yitu is also being used for security at Chinese tourist location including ports, and public spaces which require high safety standards. In its first three months of operation, it has helped Shanghai’s Metro operator to apprehend 567 lawbreakers, according to the company.

The Chinese firm has said aims to generate more revenue from overseas markets by exporting its technology overseas, to countries in Africa and Europe, where governments are grappling with the threat of terrorism.

In January, Yitu opened its first international office in Singapore, trying to use the country as a springboard to enter more adjacent markets in the region including Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.

The global facial recognition market is forecast to be worth US$6.5 billion by 2021, up from US$2.3 billion in 2016, according to estimates by the research company Technavio."
274;748678708;20180418;2018;https://blog.kurtosys.com/the-fintech-world-series-japan/;"Fintech is exploding.

It is a global industry, striving to change the future of finance.

…And the future is now. At Kurtosys, we’ve set out to cover exactly what’s happening in the financial industry the world over, one country at a time. With so many places contributing to the advancement of our digital world, each deserves their own time in the spotlight.

Often considered a laggard in its adoption of fintech, Japan’s strong economy and history of technological advancement is finally being matched by the government’s growing interest in the rise of its fintech sector.

As the second most expensive city in the world, Japan is known for many large numbers. Not only is it made up of around 6,852 islands, this packed country houses over 126 million citizens. It’s no surprise that its capital houses 35 million people; the greater Tokyo area is the largest metropolitan area globally. Whilst Japan’s population has the largest proportion of elderly people in the world (21%), it can (ironically) be characterised as one of the most innovative places for ‘new’ technologies: their trains have average delays of around 18 seconds (an engineering marvel), and the whole world knows that Japan is responsible for some groundbreaking gaming companies, namely Nintendo and Sega, masterminds that have dreamt up such delights as Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog and Pokémon, with the latter’s latest success in cultural phenomena being Pokémon Go, a game that has influenced every industry’s views and adoption of augmented reality. Hyper-reality is a common theme in Japanese culture: manga comics (the Japanese used more paper for this medium than for toilet paper), anime and film-making (Studio Ghibli being a class act) really displays the country’s imaginative forms of storytelling and electronic expertise. Plus, the Japanese brought us Takeshi’s Castle.

Yet, for all of Japan’s phenomenal world-leading technological advancement (it ranked 6th in Bloomberg’s Innovation Index this year) it is its financial technology sector that has remained fairly dormant with Japan’s neighbours taking the fintech reins early on.

Bank to Basics

One of the biggest influencers on the lack of affinity with fintech is the fact that the Japanese are still very much fans of bank branches. In 2013, as Reuters notes, the number of commercial branches per 1000 square kilometers in the country was 103. This statistic places Japan as one of the highest in the world for its amount of physical bank branches, certainly the most in Asia with many countries still remaining unbanked or underbanked. Digital banking is therefore not part of the financial psyche in Japan, and there are a few examples displaying why.

Firstly, whilst many of the fintech forerunners in the world are showing increased teamwork between traditional banks and digital disruptors, three megabanks in Japan (Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho) only introduced a one-time password system for its online banking users in the last two years. Elsewhere, the popular Japan Post Bank represents an old-school financial body, which works independently of the government’s own efforts to reform the financial sector and, run by the Japanese Bankers Association, the Zengin System is a clearing network still used by many Japanese companies to wire salaries to their employees.

As stated by Toshio Taki, who has a number of roles within fintech in Japan (co-founder of Money Forward, advisor to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, head of FinTech Institute of Japan), companies and individuals alike are clearly not too enamoured by digital finance just yet. He states that there is even a cultural stigma surrounding the idea of ‘debt’ which is highlighted by the limited number of Japanese credit card users. ATMs are mostly free in Japan too, with cash remaining the preferred choice of currency; even the shunning of digital efforts is outlined in a lack of cloud-based accounting software. These are certainly areas that Taki’s Money Forward (and other fintechs) are attempting to transfer to digital, but we’ll come to those startups later.

Evidently there’s a cumbersome attitude towards digital finance, but Japan’s actual efforts from industry players, regulators, the government and even the large banks have gone massively understated, dwarfed by Japan’s neighbouring economies such as China, Hong Kong, South Korea or Singapore.

The Rising Sun of Fintech

Now seems to be the time whereby Japan is leveraging its status as the world’s third largest economy to develop its fintech services through a more sustainable and scalable environment for innovation. Deloitte’s rundown of global fintech hubs names Tokyo as the 5th Global Financial Centre, with a Global Innovation Index score of 16 – clearly the fairly abject opinion of Japan’s fintech status is unfounded. It’s taken a little longer than others to get going with financial technology due to the points brought up before, but regulators are beginning to relax laws to best advance the fintech space, whilst the Fintech Association of Japan (FAJ) is placing pressure on banks to more readily fund fintech startups.

The Fintech Association of Japan, as of 2017, has a membership of 72 members, and is just one outfit pursuing the furthered status of fintech companies within Japan’s financial ecosystem, featured here:

Founded in January 2016 was FINOLAB. It comprises 38 partner companies and is a joint project of Mitsubishi Estate, Dentsu and ISID. Mentors at the accelerator are called FINOVATORS.

Blockchain Collaborative Consortium (BCCC) was founded in April 2016 and has 134 participating companies to look into ways for blockchain technology to be used by financial institutions.

The Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) was also founded in April 2016.

Yet as well as these fintech-focused organisations, other institutions are doing their bit to help out too, like these financial heavyweights…

Mitsubishi UFJ: Established its own Digital Accelerator program in 2015, which lasts for 4 months to support commercialisation for startups. The Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group also launched a fintech unit with 32 banks nationwide and invested ¥3 billion into Japan Digital Design Inc. for the development of AI, blockchain usage and cashless mobile services.

Mizuho Financial Group: Held ‘Mizuho.hack’ in 2016 with Mizuho Bank, a hackathon to support open innovation. Its theme revolved around finding new banking services featuring Pepper the robot, used at many Mizuho bank branches. Mizuho also launched SMART FOLIO, a robo-advisory service that was a first for Japanese banks.

Hitachi: This Japanese conglomerate set up two California-based innovation centres. In 2015, the Global Centre for Social Innovation was established in Santa Clara, followed by a fintech innovation lab and R&D centre in Silicon Valley in 2016.

Fujitsu: Hosted a consortium called Financial Innovation SQUARE, which plans meetups between fintech companies and financial institutions.

IBM: The Japanese branch of the tech company has supported financial institutions to open API and runs its own incubation program, ‘IBM Bluehub’.

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group plans to invest ¥20 billion in fintech before 2022.

…as well as…

Nomura Asset Management: Developed “Funds Robo” robo advisor in April 2016, as well as its “moneby” smartphone app to teach about investing. Nomura Bank also offers another robo-advisor service “Goal-Based” via Nomura Securities.

…plus the government, under the watchful eye of Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe…

Abe’s Cabinet developed the “Japan Revitalization Strategy 2016” in order to promote business development and regulation efforts. This (of course) features a lean on Japanese fintech.

Fintech has been considered as 1 of 5 strategic sectors for the government to boost in the coming years.

The “Council on Investments for the Future” was first held at the Prime Minister’s Office in September 2016, looking at growth strategies across many different industries.

There is an aim for over 80 banks to open their API within a 3 year timeframe.

Looking to raise cashless payment ratio to 40% in 10 years.

Abe’s governmental support is also furthered by the efforts of its Financial Services Agency (FSA), which has launched other initiatives and reforms. Here’s a little timeline of what’s been burgeoning the Japanese fintech landscape (with information found here):

March 2013: Revision of The Centre for Financial Industry Information Systems’ ‘FISC Security Guidelines on Computer Systems for Banking and Related Financial Institutions’. This was intended to spread the use of cloud computing.

December 2015: The FSA launched its ‘Fintech Support Desk’ to create a supportive environment for startups and to handle enquiries from the private sector.

May 2016: a reformation of the Banking Act made it easier for banks to invest in financial IT companies. Foreign banks wishing to engage in banking in Japan can now obtain a license and set up a single regional branch as a Japanese base.

May 2016: Amendment of the Payment Services Act allows for the further regulation of cryptocurrencies and the possibility to register foreign funds transfer service providers.

13 March 2017 – The FSA and MAS (Singapore) announce framework for fintech links between companies.

9 May 2017: The FSA and the UK’s FCA arrange for a regulatory referral system to enter each other’s market.

9 June 2017: Cabinet approved the ‘Growth Strategy 2017’, comprising of a regulatory sandbox scheme to spur innovation in AI, big data, distributed ledger technology, drones and self-driving vehicles.

July 2017: Further Banking Act reform, increasing regulation on electronic banking settlement agency services and the support of Open API.

October 2017: Government approves Bitcoin to help grow fintech industry and issued 11 licenses to let companies operate as legal cryptocurrency exchanges in September.

As reported this year, the past 5 years has already seen a 40% increase in retail customers using computers or mobile devices, which starts to show the cherry blossoming of fintech. Despite Japan originally having more electronic toilet seats than personal computers, the drive from regulators, the government and banks is upping the usage of personal devices.

In one fascinating instance, Japan’s messaging app rival to world-famous WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Line is already looking to get ahead in the cryptocurrency space, with the latest governmental embrace of the often-outlawed digital assets being highlighted above. With Japan becoming the first country to introduce cryptocurrency regulation, it has become the largest market for cryptocurrency trading, and as reported by City AM, Line has taken this opportunity to apply to the FSA to become a fully licensed virtual currency exchange. Given Line Pay’s usage by 200 million people across Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia (and handling ¥450 billion worth of transactions), cryptocurrency trading (and the legitimacy thereof?) looks set to increase, particularly in Japan.

To finish this insight into Japanese fintech, ironically here are investors and startups looking to begin the new dawn of fintech in the Land of the Rising Sun:

Investors

Globis Capital Partners

Monex

Rakuten

Startups

From the KPMG Fintech 100 2017’s Emerging 50 list…

Moneytree – Japan’s number one financial data aggregation platform. Its first product – a personal finance app – consolidates bank accounts, credit cards, digital money and loyalty points into a mobile banking application. It has over 1,300,000 users on iOS, Android and online and Moneytree LINK has almost twenty enterprise clients. It was founded in 2012 by Ross Sharrott, Paul Chapman (CEO), Mark Makdad and Jonathan Epstein (Chairman) and is based in the capital, Tokyo.

…as well as these innovative services:

bitFlyer – Japan’s number one bitcoin exchange market by trading market, with its own proprietary blockchain format Chainflyer. Users and businesses can buy, sell, and spend bitcoins through a secure platform, and their site allows clients to control their accounts through an API interface. It is the only exchange in Japan that does official auditing. It was founded in January 2014 by Takafumi Komiyama and Yuzo Kano.

Freee – Accounting software particularly aimed at SMEs. It syncs with your bank accounts and segments entries to create financial reports, as well as tracking expenses, automating payroll, sending invoices and much more. Since its launch in 2013 it has over 500,000 registered businesses, and was founded by its CEO, Daisuke Sasaki, based in Tokyo.

Money Design – A robo-advisor for individuals, Money Design’s Theo application uses AI and algorithms once only available to professional investors. Now, users can invest in 35 world currencies and 11,900 different stocks from 65 countries. It charges an annual management fee of 1%, but users are able to stop at any time. The application automatically balances your account based on your investing goals. The company was founded in 2013 by Nao Kitazawa (COO) and is also based in Tokyo.

Money Forward – A personal financial management service, which also doubles as cloud-based accounting software. Users are able to report expenses, do payroll, collect payments and send invoices, as well as utilize Money Forward’s services for income tax assistance. It is currently used by 3.5 million individuals and around 500,000 businesses use its cloud software. It was founded in 2012 in Tokyo by Chihiro Asano, Toshio Taki and Yosuke Tsuji (CEO).

Even if some fintech commentators talk down, or even fully forget, the fintech actions that are occurring in Japan, it seems unrealistic to ignore its potential. Given Shinzo Abe’s clear vision to open up regulation for national and foreign banks, as well as the combined efforts of traditional institutions and newcomers to the financial scene, Japan is looking to remove the fixed bank-branch mindset to give financial freedom to the digitalised Japanese population.

MFS Africa has become the first African fintech funded by a China-based VC in a $4.5 million Series B round led by LUN Partners Group. Goodwell Investments, an Amsterdam-based firm, as well as several angel investors, completed the round.

According to MFS Africa, it operates the largest digital payments network in Africa – and it’s accessible via one API. The company connects over 170 million mobile wallets through 100+ partners, including Airtel, Ecobank, MTN, Orange and Vodafone across 55 markets. As part of the deal, MFS Africa will work with LUN Partners to tap into the financial inclusion market in countries targeted by China’s “Belt and Road” initiative.

US micro-loan start-up Tala (formerly InVenture) has got $50 million in Series C equity investment led by Revolution Growth. Additional participants include existing investors IVP, Data Collective, Lowercase Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Female Founders Fund. Tala has also recently raised an additional $15 million for its loan book. The round brings Tala’s total fundraising to more than $105 million. The new investment will be used to promote its consumer lending app in Mexico and India. It already operates in Kenya, Tanzania and the Philippines.

The firm says it uses a combination of Android and behavioural data to underwrite customers who have little or no formal credit history. Via an Android smartphone in Tala’s markets, users can download the app, apply for a loan, and receive an “instant decision”. Tala disburses loans between $10 and $500 to a mobile wallet or via payment rails of the customer’s choosing. It adds that more than 85% of Tala’s customers receive credit in less than ten minutes.

Singapore-based peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform Funding Societies (also known as Modalku in Indonesia), has raised $25 million in Series B funding. Led by SoftBank Ventures Korea, the funding round also includes existing investors Sequoia India, Alpha JWC Ventures (Indonesia) and Golden Gate Ventures. Qualgro and LINE Ventures also participated. As with the two companies above, Funding Societies wants a piece of the financial inclusion market – although specifically in Southeast Asia.

In January 2018, the platform says it crossed the SGD$100 million ($76.3 million) mark in crowdfunded SME loans, which marked a 300% growth of its loan book since the same period in 2016. Funding Societies adds that its platform has also increased its lender base beyond 60,000 in less than three years of operation.

Malaysia-based investment platform HelloGold has secured Series A funding from Silicon Valley venture capital firm 500 Startups. The funding will be used for the integration and testing of blockchain elements on its mobile app. The firm says it offers the “world’s first Shariah-compliant platform to buy, store and sell physical investment-grade gold”. HelloGold is migrating its platform to Ethereum smart contracts in H2 2018. The funding amount was not disclosed.

Earlier this year HelloGold launched GOLDX – its Shariah-compliant Ethereum ERC20 cryptocurrency “backed by 99.99% investment-grade gold” – using smart contracts to digitise gold and make gold exchangeable outside its platform."

Avatec aims to help banks and finance companies to be more efficient and more accurate when assessing the credit quality of potential customers, including those who are new to credit. The digital solution can also be extended to companies in sectors such as e-commerce, retail, and travel that offer financial products such as point-of-sale financing.

27% in SEA are Bank account holder

According to KPMG, only 27 percent of Southeast Asia’s 600 million people hold a bank account. Within this segment, many people are still underserved when it comes to being able to access credit. These include young professionals at the beginning of their careers and small businesses.

Avatec provides companies offering financial products with an innovative next-generation credit assessment solution that analyses a broader set of digitized data beyond that which is traditionally used in evaluating personal or business credit applications.

Avatec’s credit assessment tool harnesses the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and anti-fraud algorithms to determine an applicant’s credit quality within seconds.

Mr Dennis Tan, Chief Executive Officer Designate, Avatec, said that the new company brings together the insights gleaned from UOB’s more than 80 years of serving consumers and businesses in Southeast Asia and PINTEC’s financial technology (FinTech) capabilities to help companies tap growth opportunities within the region.

“Avatec’s end-to-end intelligent digital credit assessment solution is not only useful to financial institutions, it will also enable companies in sectors such as e-commerce, telecommunications, retail and travel to offer financial products such as point-of-sale financing, and personal and business loans quickly and efficiently. By making financial products more inclusive, these companies will be able to connect with a larger base of customers in the region,”

Mr Tan said.

Avatec is incorporated as a subsidiary company of UOB, with UOB owning the majority stake (60 per cent) and PINTEC the minority stake (40 per cent). The Bank will invest up to S$12 million in Avatec over the next two years.

Dr Dennis Khoo, Head of Regional Digital Bank and Strategic Initiatives, UOB, said the Bank’s strategic investment in Avatec is the first in a series of groundbreaking digital initiatives that will be launched in 2018.

“Robust credit risk management is fundamental to the strength of the financial system. Avatec’s next-generation digital solution will enhance the performance of our business through the underwriting of better quality loans to more customers who previously would not have had access to credit.

The customer experience will also be simpler and faster as customers will know almost instantly if their online application for a loan with UOB is approved.While UOB will benefit from Avatec’s unique credit assessment capability and advanced analytics, we expect other companies too will use the solution to seize new business opportunities and to spur more financial inclusion across the region,”

Dr Khoo said.

Mr William Wei, founder and CEO of PINTEC said that the partnership with UOB will help the financial technology firm to expand further into Southeast Asia.

“There is a growing demand for financial technology (FinTech) solutions in Southeast Asia as companies explore using technology to capture growth opportunities in the digital economy.

As a leading independent technology platform enabling financial services in China, we are well-positioned to meet the needs of companies who want to use technology to serve more customers and to serve them better.

Our collaboration with UOB, a leading bank in the region, will assist us with the expansion of our FinTech solutions into Southeast Asia. This is the next phase of our strategy in the region, which is also in line with China’s Belt and Road Initiative,”

Mr Wei said.

Avatec will launch its next-generation digital credit assessment solution in Indonesia, followed by other Southeast Asian markets within the next two years.

UOB will have a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture, the bank said in a regulatory filing on Monday (April 16).

Avatec will have an issued and paid-up capital of up to S$10 million and will be a subsidiary of UOB.

It will offer credit services and solutions, primarily in South-east Asian countries. In particular, it aims to tap data technology for credit assessment, scoring and selection, with commercial applications supporting micro, consumer and small and medium enterprise lending activities.

Avatec will launch its next-generation digital credit assessment solution in Indonesia, followed by other Southeast Asian markets within the next two years, the bank said at a press briefing on Monday.

UOB cited data from KPMG showing that only 27 per cent of Southeast Asia's 600 million people hold a bank account, suggesting that many people are still underserved in terms of accessing credit.

Dr Dennis Khoo, head of regional digitial bank and strategic initiatives, said during the press briefing that with the availibility of non-bank information today, banks can access about ten times the data points that they currently tap. These data points allow banks to extend loans to clients who previously did not have acess to credit, and at lower loss rates.

He said such a collaboration is likely the first for a regional bank, and is the first in a series of ""groundbreaking digital initiatives"" that will be launched by UOB in 2018."

Jakarta (ANTARA News) - The Indonesian government will soon complete a draft regulation on e-commerce, in order to create business equality in the country, Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said.



E-commerce is inevitable; however, the government wants business equality between e-commerce traders and conventional traders, he stated, while addressing a seminar and limited-working meeting of the Indonesian Association of Shopping Centers (APPBI) here, on Thursday.



""I want the same level of playing field. We will complete the draft government regulation in two weeks or one month,"" he noted.



Lukita remarked that he will propose that imported garlic should pass through the bonded logistics zone to check it more easily.



""We will propose that the imported goods should pass through the bonded logistics zone first. Therefore, we will relocate warehouses to the zone. Otherwise, the goods will go unchecked,"" he revealed.



He asked conventional traders to anticipate a shift in people`s lifestyle in almost all parts of the world.



The real sector is part of the economic activities, which create more jobs and contribute to the Indonesian economy, he added.



""We must adjust to it. We cannot oppose the mainstream. The adjustment is needed as each country has its own characteristics. But do not underestimate the intention to do business,"" he pointed out.

He told NutraIngredients-Asia​: ""​There has been a boom in start-ups in South East Asia, because region has reached a golden age where opportunities abound, whether in e-commerce, agriculture or food technology.​

""Globally and in the region, large MNCs are losing a fair portion of their market share to local brands from SMEs. This phenomenon has ensured funding availability for promising start-ups, and their success stories are another reason why many others want to capitalise on the opportunity.""​

Now trending

There is a clear trend of more consumers seeking health and wellness, and their main areas of concern are healthier alternatives, organically sourced products with 'natural' ingredients, and clean-label products (i.e., free from additives, artificial flavours and colouring and processed ingredients).

Gunvante said, ""These trends are driving companies to improve their product compositions by making them healthier, through various routes such as using natural ingredients, reducing fat, sugar and / or salt in their existing products, identifying new technologies, and making formulas without artificial flavours or food additives.​

""Furthermore, product developers are designing and developing tailored products targeting different consumers who face potential health risks.""​

Category is…

As a result, several categories of functional foods and supplements have become increasingly popular among consumers.

One such category is sports and active nutrition, which energy-boosting products. Matcha​, a powdered green tea often enriched with caffeine and antioxidants, and yerba mate​, derived from highly caffeinated tea leaves, are two of the most popular active nutrition product types.

With increasing emphasis on natural nutrition, products made from algae, seaweed and spirulina have flooded the market in various forms, including powders and pills.

Interest in sustainable nutrition has also grown, leading to innovations in plant- and insect-based protein sources.

While the aforementioned categories tend to cater more to the general market, targeted nutrition aims to meet specific needs.

Probiotic products, for instance, are increasingly being used by consumers for more than just gut health, with a growing number of products in the region making claims around mental health, heart health, and athletic performance.

Gunvante said: ""A key area for research and innovation is the gut microbiome, which has exploded in the last decade; there is much to be understood and applied in this area.""​

Additionally, technology's role in nutrition has grown significantly, with apps and wearable devices helping users to plan their diets and physical activity.

Fertile future

Gunvante predicted that South East Asia's health food and supplement industry was set for healthy growth over the next three to five years, with more local brands meeting consumer needs.

""​The 'natural' and 'organic' trends will accelerate, particularly in the area of probiotics, and sustainability will be high on the food sector's agenda, through packaging and across the supply chain.​

""E-commerce and technology will continue to transform the way businesses operate in the region. In the past, food technology remained largely stagnant on the first, customer-facing layer.​

""However, we can expect much innovation in the following two tiers — food sciences and food sourcing. This is a fertile area for start-ups, and we will see lot of contributions from them.""​

281;746118711;20180410;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/18744/indonesia/blockchain-use-case-indonesia/;"The Indonesian Central Bank repeatedly warns citizens about cryptocurrencies and cautions to understand the risks, but the country’s regulations are currently fairly open towards digital currencies and blockchain technology.

An actual ban only exists for cryptocurrencies in payments, but exchange platforms and ownership of crypto-assets are not. Several state-owned banks and government entities are in fact working on blockchain-based applications, and the country’s financial regulator, OJK, has encouraged this, says Pandu Sastrowardoyo, co-founder of Bali-based blockchain consulting firm Blockchain Zoo.

She points out that to use blockchain technology. Indonesia’s geography – spread across a vast area and many islands – makes it a unique case for implementations of blockchain, explains Sastrowardoyo. Indonesia’s decentralization has led to more regional autonomy, but this came with fragmentation, less oversight, and potential for fraud. It’s quite easy to move to another island with a false identity in Indonesia, Sastrowardoyo says.

Most big banks in Indonesia have announced they’re looking into blockchain technology and are thinking about potential use cases. Blockchain Zoo consults many of them. While she can’t the names involved in individual projects, Sastrowardoyo shared some ongoing blockchain implementations in Indonesia which are likely to launch within the year.

Indonesia’s Blockchain Use Case #1 – Anti Fraud

Indonesia has dozens of banks, including regional ones that operate only within a certain province. And not all of them have access to the country’s debt information system, only to bigger ones.

Thus, so-called loan stacking is a concern shared by many smaller banks – when a borrower takes out multiple loans and, in some cases, uses one to pay off another. Without consulting a centralized credit rating system, it becomes difficult to detect these cases.

Blockchain can solve this, Sastrowardoyo explains. A blockchain node is implemented between multiple banks. When people apply for a bank account, their customer information is translated into a unique hash that sits on the blockchain. If the same customer opens accounts elsewhere, the banks can see the hash, and they can flag the customer’s account as a potential for fraud.

Indonesia’s Blockchain Use Case #2 -Branchless Banking

A second application of blockchain that’s already being considered is for ATM machines. “Connectivity in Indonesia has lots of issues,” Sastrowardoyo. “If the connection to one important hub dies, the whole network goes down.”

If you implement a blockchain node on each of the ATMs, even if the main line gets disconnected, the ATMs would still be online and retains some basic functions.

Indonesia’s Blockchain Use Case #3 -Anti Corruption

There are plenty of possibilities for blockchain implementations in anti-corruption management, says Sastrowardoyo. Blockchain can help with increasing transparency, simplifying processes, and getting rid of middlemen. Put into more concrete terms, it often has to do with document management.

“The issue often occurs during the documents exchange,” Sastrowardoyo says. The process takes long, and there’s plenty of opportunity for human error and fraud.

Based on blockchain technology, it’s possible to construct a system that lets companies or different units within an organisation share documents in a secure way, without having the data leave local servers, Sastrowardoyo says. There’s a clear history of all document exchanges which reduces the possibility for fraud.

Indonesia’s Blockchain Use Case #4 -Central Bank Backed Cryptocurrency, Digital Rupiah

Sastrowardoyo confirms that there’s ongoing research looking into the creation of a Digital Rupiah, a cryptocurrency backed by the government. Rumors of this surfaced earlier this year, but the Central Bank later said the plans would not be rolled out anytime soon.

Sastrowardoyo says that what the government is considering is less of a real cryptocurrency, and more akin to an e-money system that runs on the blockchain.

Indonesia could join the short list of countries that already have, or are preparing to issue a state-run digital currency.

Separating the Hype from Real Blockchain Use Cases

These four application scenarios are all useful examples of how Indonesia is thinking about blockchain implementations. As a consultant, Sastrowardoyo has come across instances where companies force the implementation of blockchain, just so they can raise money through and ICO.

Especially when one company owns all the aspects of the process they plan to push onto the blockchain, the technology isn’t necessarily required because it could be solved with simpler tools.

Putting a marketplace that involve different stakeholders onto the blockchain makes much more sense, Sastrowardoyo. That’s what her consulting firm did for FidentiaX, a marketplace for insurance policies based in Singapore. The marketplace digitizes your insurance and you can sell them in bulk. There’s no need for a paper document transfer, which had slowed down the process of previous marketplaces significantly.

“These marketplaces already existed, but with the blockchain, it got much much better,” Sastrowardoyo says. “In my favorite ICOs, the technology is really a differentiator.”

Blockchain Zoo is based in Bali, Indonesia, and was co-founded by a group of entrepreneurs who’ve been part of the blockchain community from early on. The firm was instrumental to the formation of Indonesia’s Blockchain Association last month and works with banks, government entities, and private companies across Southeast Asia.

“Currently, not all existing QR code payments are connected, causing inefficiency for people who use [QR codes as a means of payment],” Sugeng told reporters on the sidelines of a digital economy seminar on Wednesday.

QR code payment facilities resemble electronic data code (EDC) machines and automated teller machines, he added, adding that the use of QR codes would slash investment costs because it would not require expensive equipment, only QR scanners that are widely available for smartphones.

The new regulation will become part of the country’s National Payment Gateway (GPN) program, which was launched last year by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to simplify and payment methods using a series of digitalized systems, Sugeng said.

Among the companies that have already tried the system include state-owned lender Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) and ride-hailing app Go-Jek with its electronic wallet Go-Pay. (Bbn)"

These small household-based businesses account for the bulk of firms, employment and GDP in Indonesia. Micro-entrepreneurship provides a productive source of economic welfare for families, especially the poorest.

President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) recently launched an industry roadmap, “Making Indonesia 4.0”. This details the country’s vision to boost the manufacturing industry’s competitiveness through the use of technology. Prioritising the food and drink, automotive, textile, electronics and chemicals sectors, the government hopes the roadmap will help create 10 million new jobs by 2030.

In November 2016, Jokowi presented a four-year economic plan to transform Indonesia into the largest Southeast Asian digital economy. Indonesia aims to create 1,000 high-tech startups by 2020, with a combined value of US$10 billion.

Investing in high-growth startups offers a strong potential to create jobs, spur innovation, increase productivity and internationalise local businesses. Indonesia’s hope that these 1,000 high-tech startups become medium and large firms and locomotives for the economy might come true. The sector is attracting foreign direct investments, some originating from investors such as Alibaba and Expedia.

Additionally, helping the Indonesian manufacturing industry to take advantage of automation and data-exchange technologies is a wise step.

But high-tech startup success stories shouldn’t hide the fact that the Indonesian economy and population rely mainly on a myriad of micro and small businesses that are low-tech and low-growth.

Mapping Indonesia’s businesses

In 2013, the 57,000 Indonesian medium and large firms – companies with a yearly turnover of more than Rp2.5 billion (around US$180,000) – amounted to only 3% of employment and contributed Rp2,220 trillion to the GDP.

In comparison, micro-enterprises and small firms employed about half of the Indonesian workforce. The 57.2 million micro-enterprises – companies with a yearly turnover less than Rp300 million – and 654,000 small firms (annual turnover between Rp300 million and 2.5 billion) were employing 105 million and 5.6 million people respectively.

Micro-enterprises and small firms contributed Rp3,755 trillion and Rp3,495 trillion to the GDP, respectively.

Micro-enterprises not productive?

Most micro-enterprises are informal. They specialise in the trade and services sectors and are run within the household in urban areas across the Indonesia archipelago. High-tech startups tend to concentrate in the Jakarta area.

Some studies assert that micro-entrepreneurship is not very productive, can signal economic distress, and that entrepreneurs earn less than salaried employees.

In reality, if micro-entrepreneurship does not appear as lucrative, this is because these studies fail to account for both micro-entrepreneurs’ contexts and heterogeneity.

The returns to micro-entrepreneurship should not be analysed only in terms of cash income, nor from the sole perspective of the micro-entrepreneur. We should see how it provides livelihoods to families.

Indeed, primary objectives of micro-entrepreneurship are to augment the household’s consumption and savings, and diversify the sources of income. This contributes to economic welfare and provides means for families to cope with economic vulnerability triggered by events such as layoffs, falling ill or having their house inundated by flooding.

Our research shows that Indonesian households that run microbusinesses in addition to some salaried work, either formal or informal, have higher levels of income, consumption and assets, compared to similar households that rely only on salaried employment for their livelihood. These effects are stronger for the poorest households.

A glimpse at the lives of micro-entrepreneurs

Indonesians in general exhibit strong entrepreneurial intentions, but numerous barriers hold them back.

Obtaining a business permit, or any administrative service, is a long, difficult and costly process. Pervasive corruption adds to the problems. For example, people have to bribe officials to get these business permits or administrative services.

For Indonesian micro-entrepreneurs, who are mostly poor and have low education levels, red tape and corrupt practices push them to stay in the informality. They already have to deal with poor access to external finance and collective services, such as energy and clean water provision and transportation. Many end up not registering their businesses, or run them without permits.

Having micro-entrepeneurs stay in the shadows of the formal economy is both the outcome and the cause of the poor quality of local institutions.

This is unfortunate as micro-entrepreneurship can prevent the poor from falling further below the poverty line.

For example, Supiati, who lives with her family in Jakarta, suffered from poverty and vulnerability. Supiati receives support from charity organisations Gerhati Foundation and Five Talents, which help groups in slum areas to access medical services. To support her family, Supiati prepares and sells simple food in the street.

Thanks to her small street food business, she could feed and send her kids to school. She could buy medicines to cure the chronic disease of her husband. She also bought a refrigerator that’s useful for her business and for the household.

In addition, she was able to extend her house. A new front room now serves as a kiosk for the business. These durable assets are a form of saving to reduce vulnerability, as they can be sold if necessary.

Mawar and her family also live in Jakarta. After being evicted from their home and relocated to a government-subsidised low-cost apartment, they have better living conditions, but have to pay a monthly rent.

This has created another form of insecurity. Mawar and her husband could not secure decent paying jobs due to their low education. For years, they managed to survive, barely, by combining incomes from precarious formal jobs in the factory and construction sectors, and informal jobs, such as selling scavenged cardboard collected throughout the city.

Mawar decided to open a small warung (small mom-and-pop stall) on the ground floor of her building. After a long wait, she finally obtained authorisation to establish her micro-business. This has brought in a complementary source of work and income for the family.

Need for more aggressive support for microbusinesses

In April 2016, President Jokowi announced a series of measures to improve local institutions, lower barriers to entrepreneurship and ease doing business. But progress has been slow and these reforms are hardly implemented.

Indonesia should step up its efforts to foster micro-entrepreneurship, local economic development and the welfare of people. And as one stone may catch two birds, this will also contribute to curbing local corruption, durably."

Hundreds of e-commerce companies have descended upon Indonesia in the past four years. The increase is largely thanks to Chinese investment. It’s expected to drive the country’s economic growth.



CGTN’s Silkina Ahluwalia reports.

With more than 130 million internet users in the country, Indonesia is becoming one of Asia’s largest smartphone markets. As people’s spending habits continue to shift online, Indonesia’s e-commerce market is projected to reach $45 billion in 2025, coming in third behind China and India.

President Joko Widodo has a vision to make Indonesia the “Digital Energy of Asia”, further supporting and enhancing the digital industry especially the e-commerce market.

“The e-commerce sector and digital economy has, just in the last three or four years, gone from very small to suddenly accounting for 15 to 20 percent of our total annual FDI so I estimate that annual FDI or inflow into the e-commerce industry amounts to two to three billion U.S. dollars every year now.” said Thomas Lembong the Chairman of Investment Coordinating Board.

A recent study shows that foreign investments can help Indonesia achieve its economic growth rate of more than five percent this year. The e-commerce sector is expected to be the new driver for that growth.

“We see that in the last three years at least 10 e-commerce start-ups in Indonesia injected by foreign investors especially from China. That’s why in 2017, the data around $4.8 billion in total investment, direct and indirect investment, were made to local startups.”, said Bhima Yudistira an economic analyst.

The e-commerce sector alone is growing 20 to 25 percent per year, largely credited to Chinese investors.

“Chinese e-commerce companies and Chinese digital companies are among the most sophisticated and the most advanced and of course, among the largest technology companies in the world. China is also the largest economy in Asia and a direct neighbor of Indonesia. I think the booming trend of Chinese digital companies, technology companies and e-commerce companies coming to Indonesia is highly natural and strongly welcome,” said Thomas Lembong the Chairman of Investment Coordinating Board.

The increase in the number of Chinese investors in Indonesia is proof that the two countries are continuously working closely together in hopes to achieve stronger economies."

By Veena McCoole YC ’19

More than 100,000 people die every year in Africa from counterfeit medicines, and that number is increasing. Adebayo Alonge ’16, an alumnus of the Yale School of Management Master of Advanced Management program, knows this all too well. He nearly died from counterfeit drugs in a Nigerian hospital.

Alonge relayed that experience to Amy Kao ’17, a Yale SOM alumna of the MBA program and a former consultant for the pharmaceutical industry, during the 2015 Yale Healthcare Hackathon. Today, Alonge is CEO and Kao is chief marketing officer of RxAll, a company they co-founded that’s building an artificial intelligence platform enabling spectrometers to authenticate legitimate medication.

Operating chiefly in African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya, where counterfeit drugs are widely available, the platform connects hospitals and pharmacies with verified medical wholesalers, informing pharmaceutical manufacturers of counterfeit products in real time. To date, RxAll has received funding from the Nigerian government and the Nigerian Ministry of Health, as well as InnovateHealth Yale and the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute.

“The product and business model have evolved over time, but the mission has always been to ensure that everyone has access to safe medicine and authentic drugs,” Kao explains. “In open markets in Africa, you can buy a drug that looks identical to the one you're looking for, especially malaria medication. Even in hospitals, practitioners can’t tell what is real or fake.”

Kao and Alonge’s idea for RxAll stemmed from trying to find ways to procure authentic medicines end to end on the supply chain. Kao describes the warehouse and logistics company as “an Amazon for authentic medicine” in Africa.

“Pharmacies and companies could go to our Nigeria website and order guaranteed authentic medicine, and we were able to ship the authentic medicines to them and trace these medicines from a reputable source,” she says.

While this solved the issue of counterfeit drugs, the co-founders were eager to address the root cause of who supplies such counterfeit drugs.

“We turned from a logistics model with our medication website to looping in data scientists at Yale to build a spectrometer,” explains Kao.

The process of spectroscopy involves emitting radio frequency waves on drug compounds to identify whether or not the drug is real. Despite the advanced technology required, it was important to Kao and Alonge to keep RxAll interactive. They developed an app customers could use at pharmacies when purchasing drugs: customers could scan the drugs with their phone and receive notification of whether the products were real or fake. Kao reports a 99% match rate of the spectrometer, which has been tested with several drugs in a growing database.

Kao says spectrometers typically retail for around $20,000, but RxAll’s team has been able to reduce the price to $1,000, an incredible cost saving for pharma companies in rural areas that cannot afford expensive equipment.

“We’re still trying to make a margin selling spectrometers and selling the data component, but in the future I see RxAll moving toward a model where we provide free spectrometers to local pharmacies and monetize the data,” Kao says.

With the company’s expansion to more than 200 pharmacies in Nigeria and Kenya, the data it gathered became increasingly valuable as a new revenue stream.

“The data we collect from everyone who uses our product to identify medicine and the pharmacies they shop at has become of interest to pharma companies and regulators,” Kao says. “We’ve transitioned into a data company to sell pharmaceutical data to global companies such as Merck, MSD Singapore, and Pfizer.”

Kao, who never imagined herself as an entrepreneur, credits Yale’s supportive environment and RxAll’s participation in the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute’s accelerator program as contributing factors to the company’s success.

“The resources at Yale are full of opportunities to bounce ideas off others,” she says. “Jennifer McFadden has been a tremendous help for us, as well as the social consciousness of SOM’s great community. RxAll was founded in New Haven and grown at Yale, and none of this could’ve happened without Yale's entrepreneurship resources.”

With a considerable population of international students, Yale SOM provided Kao with the opportunity to speak to students from all over the world about their experiences with medicine in their home countries. Kao connects the social mission of RxAll with the strong social impact ethos of Yale SOM.

“That’s one of the reasons I chose SOM: social entrepreneurship and being dedicated to both business and society was so important to me,” she says. “With the data component, we’re starting to see a more scalable aspect of the business, but we are still faithful to our ultimate goal and social mission.”

Last year RxAll was named one of the Top 15 startups by G Startups Worldwide at the Global Mobile Internet Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia. Kao says RxAll’s participation and pitching at this event increased their footprint on a global scale, but particularly among the South East Asian markets RxAll is looking to target. RxAll also was accepted into the prestigious Merck Accelerator Program in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as the Catapult Accelerator Program in Norway. The latter provides $150,000 to accelerator companies, and Alonge is currently in Norway building entrepreneurial connections and refining RxAll’s ideas.

RxAll is also pursuing a partnership with a leading Singapore-based pharmaceutical company, after RxAll was identified as a featured startup at the Digital Innovation Summit. According to Kao, RxAll remains involved with testing drugs and spectrometers with heavily counterfeited drugs in Africa and is piloting a similar research program in Southeast Asia.

RxAll hopes to raise $1 million in a Series A round after the completion of the Katapult accelerator in Norway, enabling it to build out the spectrometer technology and to hire people full time to work on product and solidify operating platforms. To date, most of RxAll’s $200,000 funding has come from grants, accelerators, and bootstrapping and has covered the cost of building out their prototype, platform, and team. Kao says she anticipates “taking this forward” with a clear product and business plan. She adds that RxAll is working on a few deals with pharma companies, which will be another funding source and validation of the product. Ultimately, Kao stands by the philosophy of slow and healthy growth.

“Our company made a decision not to take equity from outside investors, and that was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made,” she says. “It’s tempting to talk to VCs who are throwing equity at you, but it’s important to listen to yourself and what you want the company to be to make the best-informed decision.”

As a female lead on a largely male team, Kao encourages women who are considering entrepreneurship to take the plunge, despite the occasional difficulties women face in the startup space.

“When you’re the only woman in a roomful of male VCs and angel investors, you have to trust your voice and stand your ground,” she says. “As a female, I encourage women to retain their femininity and not do business ‘like a man’—I strive to understand them, not to replicate their stereotypical practices of dominance.”

Kao emphasizes that women often seek to connect with others by sharing their experiences, and she strives to continue offering a different perspective as a woman on her team."

Bank Mandiri Expects Equal Regulation for Bank, Fintech

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - State-owned Bank Mandiri said Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Financial Services Authority (OJK) need to continue to work on the regulation and oversee the financial technology or Fintech.

“So there is an equal regulation between traditional banks and the fintech industry,” said Bank Mandiri's Risk Management director Ahmad Siddik Badruddin said on Thursday, April 5.

According to Siddik, the innovations made by the fintech industry are very good and beneficial to the consumers.

The business of the fintech industry also offers consumer protection in order to avoid fraud, as well as clear transparency and the disclosure of information. Siddik said the fintech business must be supported.

However, he felt the need for an equal regulation so that in the end, the traditional banks will have no difficulty in competing with fintech. The Bank Mandiri director also hopes that there is no inequality of regulation between one and the other.

Shop Talk: Independent Fashion Marketplace Zilingo Closes Series C Round with $54M

The e-commerce start-up has now raised a total capital of $82M Share on

When Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor co-founded mobile marketplace Zilingo in October 2015, the big goal was to connect the highly fragmented landscape of fashion supply in Asia to fashion lovers across the globe.

It’s made headway since, having grown its revenues 11x and with now over 10,000 merchants using the platform to sell to millions of individual and wholesale customers around Asia and the world. Today, Zilingo sells in Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore, ships internationally to four more countries, and has supply bases in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

Earlier this week, the seller-centric fashion marketplace closed its Series C round, raising USD$54 million of fresh capital and taking its total funding to USD$82 million. The round was led by Sofina, Burda Principal Investments, and Sequoia Capital India, with Amadeus Capital joining in as a new investor. All existing investors participated in the round, including American billionaire Tim Draper, SIG, Venturra, Beenext, and Manik Arora.

“The Zilingo investment is special for Sequoia,” relates Shailendra Singh, managing director of Sequoia Capital (India) Singapore. “Our association started with a seed investment even before the Zilingo service was first launched. Ankiti and Dhruv have totally impressed us with the quality of team they have assembled, their innovative e-commerce strategy and playbook, and their speed and quality of execution, all of which resulted in more than 10x revenue growth in the last year. This new round, finalized weeks after the last one, is a ringing endorsement of how much potential the investor group sees in the company.”

Albert Shyy, principal at Burda, concurs. “Zilingo is creating a complete ecosystem for merchants to grow their online fashion business in Southeast Asia and beyond — we believe there is an untapped opportunity across the entire Asian fashion value chain and continue to be very impressed with the company’s trajectory,” he says.

Doubling down on Southeast Asia

With its 330 million Internet users, the potential in Southeast Asia is vast. The e-commerce market alone is expected to be worth $88 billion by 2025, with Google figures revealing Southeast Asians spend 140 minutes shopping online every month — almost twice as much time as Americans in e-commerce marketplaces.

Zilingo’s proprietary seller platform, which enables merchants to upload and manage their inventory in any language, using any currency, and connects them through 25 APIs with logistics, warehousing and payment providers, puts it in a good position to take advantage of the Southeast Asian market.

Bose recognizes that playing in the unique, high-margin category of fashion with its fast-moving cycles and nuances, entails a different approach than the rest of e-commerce.

“It’s not like buying detergent or electronics; fashion is much more about your choice, individuality, and trends,” she says, adding that “nowhere in the world has a horizontal e-commerce company also cracked fashion. The market is showing us the right signs in terms of adoption and retention, so it’s good to double down. We are grateful to all the investors for continuously showing great faith in our team and our vision for fashion commerce in this region.”

According to Pratiti Chakraborty, Zilingo’s head of finance, “the fresh infusion of capital will be used to focus deeply and boost the Indonesia business, foray into other ASEAN markets like the Philippines and the cross-border businesses.” The plan is also to further expand Zilingo’s supply base across Cambodia and Bangladesh, in addition to its existing bases in ASEAN.

It’s worth noting that Zilingo’s diverse workforce gives it a competitive edge in a market that’s anything but homogeneous. Currently, 50% of Zilingo’s leadership team are women, with members of the LGBT community well-represented.

“Being a tech company, this gives us a unique edge while scaling,” shares Bose. “Zilingo’s leadership team comes from 10 different countries in Asia, Europe, and North America, and speak in 15 different languages. The cultural diversity gives the team a unique perspective on how to solve challenges with creative solutions,” she says."

The additional funds will be used to boost business and expand into other markets to help Zilingo grow as a market leader.

Southeast Asia’s ecommerce marketplace Zilingo has raised $54 million Series C funding. The round was led by Sofina, Burda Principal Investments, and Sequoia Capital while Amadeus Capital joined in as a new investor. Existing investors Tim Draper, Venturra, Beenext, SIG, and Manik Arora also participated in this round of funding. Five months ago, Zilingo had raised $17 million Series B funding.

The fresh infusion of capital will be used to focus and boost the Indonesia business, foray into other markets, and cross-border businesses. The plan is also to further expand the supply base across Cambodia and Bangladesh in addition to ASEAN markets.

“At the same time, we’re working on some really exciting product features, and some new initiatives. There’s tons of stuff on fashion discovery, recommendations, seller analytics, and much more that’s under way, and we’re running new experiments all the time. We’re also seeing the Zilingo platform grow in many new ways, often organically, on seller, shipment, payments, finance and more,” says Ankiti Bose, Co-founder and CEO, Zilingo.

The early days

Zilingo was founded by Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor in October 2015. Ankiti was travelling across Thailand and Indonesia when she noticed that the several small and medium-sized enterprises in the region had possibly the best things to offer.

But she also noticed that despite being huge markets, where people even from other parts of Southeast Asia shopped, these stores barely had any access to digital platforms apart from Facebook, and couldn’t market themselves online effectively .

This led to the birth of Zilingo, a fashion and lifestyle marketplace built for the Southeast Asian market. Ankiti says,

“Nowhere in the world has a horizontal ecommerce company also cracked fashion. It’s a unique, high margin category which is highly dependent on fast-moving cycles and has its own nuances. Unlike buying detergent or electronics, fashion is much more about your choice, individuality, and trends. It requires a different approach than the rest of ecommerce.”

When YourStory first spoke to Zilingo in 2015, it had 1,500 merchants in Thailand and Singapore primarily focussed on selling clothes, accessories, bags, shoes, and beauty products. Now they have over 10,000 merchants across different parts of Asia.

Ankiti says Zilingo has grown 10x by revenues, launched a TV campaign in Indonesia, and expanded the merchant ecosystem to include an arsenal of services, making it a one-of-a-kind product for over 10,000 merchants and private labels across Asia.

The team charges sellers a commission of 10-15 percent on each successful transaction. Zilingo also offers sellers features like payments, marketing, order management, inventory, cataloging, and pricing — complete with analytics and intelligence - free of charge. They are, however, charged for per-order fulfilment. The average order size has gone up from $40 to $60.

Building the technology

However, building it to this scale had its challenges. Dhruv, Co-founder and CTO adds that the first launch of the core backend infrastructure, and first seller and buyer apps took around three months. While the platform is headquartered in Indonesia, the core technology is driven in Bengaluru.

“It was really hectic, but lots of fun, and the team really came together back then. During those initial months, we figured out that given our outsized ambition, we’d keep wanting to add more intelligence, automation, and data on all fronts, and therefore architectured the core infrastructure as a set of microservices. This proved immensely beneficial for us as we started scaling.”

Dhruv adds that they are now a marketplace with buyers in three countries and sellers in six, speaking many different languages, selling across borders, and also in bulk. “Logistics and payment systems integrate with around 20 different partners for seamless shipment and checkout in our three buyer markets. We’re a team of just over 35 developers, product folks, and designers, and we also are hiring,"" he says.

The collaboration between Southeast Asia and India isn’t difficult. At Zilingo, technology and product teams interface with business teams directly and spend sufficient time in the markets.

According to Dhruv, this tends to work well, because they have ownership of their products or services, and also the ability to take key decisions along with business.

“Product and tech folks travel quite a bit to our offices in Jakarta, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Singapore, both for face time and to learn more about the market first hand. What also helps, besides the travel and ownership, is that we keep launching and iterating fast,” Dhruv says .

Collaboration is the key

The team had realised early on that the scale the platform was looking for would mean that they have to get really good at architecturing complex, distributed systems. The team began with building a fair bit of good technology for this (and often on the shoulders of great open source projects).

“We turned these solutions into internal libraries and that dramatically made development faster. At the same time, we had to have highly automated dev ops from day one, and that was another key area of work,” Dhruv says.

The tech team works on Facebook-style continuous everyday launches. The developers ship products with automation and internal screens to control almost every aspect of what’s happening on the platform. For eg, the teams have internal screens to switch on and off payment methods or reconfigure shipment flows, and many data dashboards.

This allows developers to spend time working on new initiatives, iterating on product, and building core systems, and travel and have face time with business interests when starting on new things.

A lucrative market itself, Southeast Asia also presents competitors like Zalora. A large ecommerce fashion platform, Zalora claims to have had over 17 million monthly visits from across the ASEAN region as of end 2014, and had received funding of over $238 million. Last month, the Ayala group acquired 49 percent stake in Zalora.

Other players include Ava in the Philippines, Chon.vn in Vietnam, FatFish-backed Dressabelle, Jungle Ventures-backed Pomelo, YJ Capital-backed VIP Plaza, Blue Bird Group Owner Indra Djokosoetono-backed Maskoolin, 8Wood, and Cloth Inc.

A TechCrunch report states that in Thailand alone, the GMV (gross merchandise value) from sites like Facebook and Instagram for small businesses was $510 million. The report states this accounted for a third of the total ecommerce GMV of Thailand. Higher per capita income and a spurt in infrastructure in Southeast Asia over the last two years has boosted the space, Ankiti says.

Ltd has raised $54 million (Rs 351 crore) in a Series C round led by Belgium-based investment company Sofina, besides existing investors, German investment firm Burda Principal Investments, and Sequoia Capital India.

Besides Amadeus Capital, which came in as a new investor, existing investors, SIG, Venturra and Beenext, also participated in the round. US-based venture capital firm Draper Associates founder Tim Draper, and Manik Arora, the founder of family office of IDG Ventures India have also pumped in money.

With this transaction, Zelingo has so far raised $82 million. According to a company statement, the fresh funds will be used to grow further and expand internationally.

The Thailand-headquartered firm was founded by Ankiti Bose, the CEO, and Dhruv Kapoor, the CTO, in 2015. Bose is a former McKinsey consultant from Mumbai, who also had a stint in Sequoia Capital’s Bengaluru office. Kapoor, an IIT Guwahati alumnus, had previously worked with Yahoo and Kiwi, an American gaming startup.

“We think the market is showing us the right signs in terms of adoption and retention, so it is good to double down. We are grateful to all the investors for continuously showing great faith in our team and our vision for fashion commerce in this region,” said Bose.

Last September, Sequoia Capital and Burda had led a $17-million Series B round in Zilingo.

The Zilingo app allows merchants to upload pictures of their products and provides them with free shipping, packaging, doorstep pickup, secure payment options, a mobile analytics dashboard and consultation on pricing strategy. Buyers can also chat with sellers, exchange photos, create wish lists, take notes and track products.

Today, Zilingo sells its products across its home countries of Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore and ships internationally to four more nations. It also has supply bases in across China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia.

“Zilingo is creating a complete ecosystem for merchants to grow their online fashion business in Southeast Asia and beyond. We believe there is an untapped opportunity across the entire Asian fashion value chain and continue to be very impressed with the company’s trajectory,” said Albert Shyy, principal at Burda.

According to the company, over 10,000 independent merchants and private labels use the platform across Asia. It has over 25 API integrations for logistics and payments that allow sellers to ship from one location to multiple countries. Zilingo Seller Centre allows merchants to manage an online store in a language and currency of their choice, sell across different countries and receive payments internationally for orders in their local currency.

The company also runs a business-to-business (B2B) vertical, Zilingo’s AsiaMall, which allows merchants around the world to buy from wholesale Asian suppliers. Zilingo claims to have grown 10 times in revenues over the past one year."

Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S Iswaran told industry participants at Channel NewsAsia’s Asia Business First Forum 2018 on Wednesday (Mar 28) that negotiations between Singapore and ASEAN member states are ongoing to finalise this agreement by the end of 2018.

Under the agreement, regulations will be streamlined to help companies who are finding it confusing to navigate the varying e-commerce regulations across the ASEAN countries given that the region’s e-commerce scene remains in its infancy.



Mr Iswaran said: “This will provide a platform for aspiring entrepreneurs, start-ups and micro, small and medium enterprises, to market their products and services regionally, while making it easier for them to send and receive electronic payments.”



In a dialogue session during the forum, Mr Iswaran said that while the wave of technological changes has already created profound challenges for some businesses across sectors, more can be done to help these businesses embrace technology and “unlock their potential”.



“Whilst there may be challenges from digitalisation, the opportunities and potential to unlock the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, are enormous if on various efforts to do this. And if we can now bring it together and create an ASEAN digital value proposition, I think that will really unlock a new trajectory of growth.”

As such, Mr Iswaran said ASEAN must resist the tendency to “look inwards” and instead, stay resolute in its commitment to regional economic integration, so as to bring about benefits for businesses and create good job opportunities for people.



Singapore will also take the advantage of its chairmanship to work on an ASEAN Innovation Network (AIN), said Mr Iswaran.



The intent is to strengthen the networks between the innovation ecosystems in ASEAN to “spark new collaborations and solutions” to enable our companies to better respond to demands from the increasingly sophisticated and growing consumer base in the region, Mr Iswaran said.



Singapore is also enhancing its engagements with ASEAN through bilateral initiatives like an intensification of engagements with long-time partners, such as Malaysia and Indonesia.



Mr Iswaran also said the ASEAN Single Window - which seeks to help traders cut costs by expediting cargo clearance and reducing paperwork - has gone live for Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam earlier this year."

The company said it took into consideration several aspects before opening new routes, including the destination city’s gross domestic product (GDP), to assess the business prospects.

“These [new routes] will benefit Citilink, because we can optimize the utilization of our fleet,” Citilink finance director Fransetya Hutabarat said on the Citilink flight to Penang on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Andy Adrian Febryanto, Citilink Indonesia’s chief commercial officer, said the new routes would be within a range of four to five flying hours, a distance coverable by Airbus A320 planes.

303;742441325;20180327;2018;https://www.city.yale.edu/blog/2018/3/26/startup-saves-lives-by-ridding-african-market-of-counterfeit-drugs;"More than 100,000 people die every year in Africa from counterfeit medicines, and that number is increasing. Adebayo Alonge (SOM ’16), a student in the SOM Master of Advanced Management program, knows all too well. He nearly died from counterfeit drugs in a Nigerian hospital.

Alonge relayed that experience to Amy Kao (SOM ’17), a former consultant for the pharmaceutical industry, during the 2015 Yale Healthcare Hackathon. Today, Alonge is CEO and Kao is chief marketing officer of RxAll, a company they co-founded that’s building an artificial intelligence platform enabling spectrometers to authenticate legitimate medication.

Operating chiefly in African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya, where counterfeit drugs are widely available, the platform connects hospitals and pharmacies with verified medical wholesalers, informing pharmaceutical manufacturers of counterfeit products in real time. To date, RxAll has received funding from the Nigerian government and the Nigerian Ministry of Health, as well as InnovateHealth Yale and the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute.

""The product and business model have evolved over time, but the mission has always been to ensure that everyone has access to safe medicine and authentic drugs,"" Kao explains. ""In open markets in Africa, you can buy a drug that looks identical to the one you're looking for, especially malaria medication. Even in hospitals, practitioners can't tell what is real or fake.""

Kao and Alonge's idea for RxAll stemmed from trying to finding ways to procure authentic medicines end to end on the supply chain. Kao describes the warehouse and logistics company as ""an Amazon for authentic medicine"" in Africa.

""Pharmacies and companies could go to our Nigeria website and order guaranteed authentic medicine, and we were able to ship the authentic medicines to them and trace these medicines from a reputable source,"" she says.

While this solved the issue of counterfeit drugs, the co-founders were eager to address the root cause of who supplies such counterfeit drugs.

""We turned from a logistics model with our medication website to looping in data scientists at Yale to build a spectrometer,"" explains Kao.

The process of spectroscopy involves emitting radio frequency waves on drug compounds to identify whether or not the drug is real. Despite the advanced technology required, it was important to Kao and Alonge to keep RxAll interactive. They developed an app customers could use at pharmacies when purchasing drugs: the customer could scan the drugs with their phone and receive notification of whether the product was real or fake. Kao reports a 99% match rate of the spectrometer, which has been tested with several drugs in a growing database.

Kao says spectrometers typically retail for around $20,000, but RxAll's team has been able to reduce the price to $1,000, an incredible cost saving for pharma companies in rural areas that cannot afford expensive equipment.

""We're still trying to make a margin selling spectrometers and selling the data component, but in the future I see RxAll moving toward a model where we provide free spectrometers to local pharmacies and monetize the data,"" Kao says.

With the company’s expansion to over 200 pharmacies in Nigeria and Kenya, the data it gathered became increasingly valuable as a new revenue stream.

""The data we collect from everyone who uses our product to identify medicine and the pharmacies they shop at has become of interest to pharma companies and regulators,"" Kao says. ""We've transitioned into a data company to sell pharmaceutical data to global companies such as Merck, MSD Singapore and Pfizer.""

Kao, who never imagined herself as an entrepreneur, credits Yale's supportive environment and RxAll's participation in the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute's accelerator program as contributing factors to the company's success.

""The resources at Yale are full of opportunities to bounce ideas off others,"" she says. ""Jennifer McFadden has been a tremendous help for us, as well as the social consciousness of SOM's great community. RxAll was founded in New Haven and grown at Yale, and none of this could've happened without Yale's entrepreneurship resources.”

With a considerable population of international students, Yale SOM provided Kao with the opportunity to speak to students from all over the world about their experiences with medicine in their home countries. Kao connects the social mission of RxAll with the strong social impact ethos of Yale SOM.

""That's one of the reasons I chose SOM: social entrepreneurship and being dedicated to both business and society was so important to me,"" she says. ""With the data component, we're starting to see a more scalable aspect of the business, but we are still faithful to our ultimate goal and social mission.""

Last year RxAll was named one of the Top 15 startups by G Startups Worldwide at the Global Mobile Internet Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia. Kao said RxAll's participation and pitching at this event increased their footprint on a global scale, but particularly among the South East Asian markets RxAll is looking to target. RxAll also was accepted into the prestigious Merck Accelerator Program in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as the Catapult Accelerator Program in Norway. The latter provides $150,000 to accelerator companies, and Alonge is currently in Norway building entrepreneurial connections and refining RxAll's ideas.

RxAll is also pursuing a partnership with a leading Singapore-based pharmaceutical company, after RxAll was identified as a featured startup at the Digital Innovation Summit. According to Kao, RxAll remains involved with testing drugs and spectrometers with heavily counterfeited drugs in Africa and is piloting a similar research program in South East Asia.

RxAll hopes to raise $1 million in a Series A round after the completion of the Katapult accelerator in Norway, enabling it to build out the spectrometer technology and hire people full time to work on product and solidify operating platforms. To date, most of RxAll's $200,000 funding has come from grants, accelerators and bootstrapping and has covered the cost of building out their prototype, platform and team. Kao says she anticipates ""taking this forward"" with a clear product and business plan. She adds that RxAll is working on a few deals with pharma companies, which will be another funding source and validation of the product. Ultimately, Kao stands by the philosophy of slow and healthy growth.

""Our company made a decision not to take equity from outside investors, and that was one of the best decisions we've ever made,"" she says. ""It's tempting to talk to VCs who are throwing equity at you, but it's important to listen to yourself and what you want the company to be to make the best-informed decision.""

As a female lead on a largely male team, Kao encourages women who are considering entrepreneurship to take the plunge, despite the occasional difficulties women face in the startup space.

""When you're the only woman in a roomful of male VCs and angel investors, you have to trust your voice and stand your ground,"" she says. ""As a female, I encourage women to retain their femininity and not do business ‘like a man’ — I strive to understand them, not to replicate their stereotypical practices of dominance.""

Kao emphasizes that women often seek to connect with others by sharing their experiences, and she strives to continue offering a different perspective as a woman on her team.

They shouldn’t, said a former Microsoft Corp executive who’s now in charge of driving the country’s digital economy.

Policy makers are serious about developing the sector that created more than 170,000 new jobs and contributed 18.2% of gross domestic product in 2017, said Datuk Yasmin Mahmood, chief executive officer of government agency Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC).

MDEC’s initiatives to encourage entrepreneurs to set up shop in the country of 32 million people span new immigration policies and tax incentives, Yasmin said in an interview in Singapore last Tuesday. Malaysia grants a one-year visit pass for tech entrepreneurs based overseas and up to a decade of tax exemption for startups, including those that are fully foreign-owned, she said.

“We are open for the world to come and play,” said Yasmin, who held management positions in the Malaysian offices of Dell Corp and Microsoft before joining MDEC in 2014.

“The private sector is going to lead the digital economy and the government is going to be the wind beneath their wings.”

Such measures have helped technology companies generate total revenue of US$13bil in 2017, up 8% from 2016, she said.

Still, Malaysia lags behind its neighbours in drawing investments. Singapore attracted US$7.2bil in tech startup capital from 2012 through September 2017, the most in SouthEast Asia, according to CB Insights. Indonesia pulled in US$4.6bil, while Malaysia got US$1.3bil during the same period.

There are some wins. CXS International, a workforce and talent analytics platform, relocated its headquarters from Norway to Malaysia, while Vickers Venture Partners, a Singapore-based VC firm, opened its office in Kuala Lumpur in February.

German entrepreneur Jonathan Weins co-founded healthy food delivery app Dahmakan in Malaysia and the startup is part of a growing number that are expanding beyond Malaysia.

Kuala Lumpur-based iFlix, co-founded by serial entrepreneurs Patrick Grove and Mark Britt, offers a cheaper alternative to Netflix tailored to customers in emerging markets and has expanded across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

The beginning of the year is always an exciting time for the mobile industry, when most stakeholders join the crowds at Mobile World Congress in late February. This year was no exception for our programme, as we were joined by our partners from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Australian Government, mobile operators and 13 of our current portfolio start-ups to announce our second cohort of Innovation Fund start-ups.

With 15 new additions, our portfolio now comprises 24 start-ups from 15 countries across Asia Pacific and Africa. They cover more sectors and business models (‘agritech’ in particular—see the section on ‘Mobile technology for the SDGs’) and a wider range of innovative uses of mobile technology as SMEs look to solve local problems. We hope this will in turn help us to identify and highlight more ways these start-ups can collaborate with mobile operators to boost their reach and impact.

Some of the start-ups featured in this report have already reached significant scale. Agritech start-up Twiga Foods in Kenya now delivers 350,000 bananas daily to food stalls in Nairobi, with most of the payments across the value chain processed through M-Pesa. Ruangguru in Indonesia has just passed the 7 million registered users mark and launched a joint data plan with local mobile operator Telkomsel. Such stories confirm the value of integrating mobile technology and working with mobile operators, which is becoming more and more relevant to start-ups. Meanwhile, mobile operators are gearing up to be better partners, for instance, by launching new funds or collaborating across regions.

Building on this momentum, we have launched our third call for applications to the Innovation Fund. The core eligibility criteria remain unchanged (post-revenue, socio-economic impact, willingness to engage with operators, matching funding), and we are more open than ever to new and innovative uses of mobile technology (e.g. big data, IoT) and models. Applications are open until 15 April, and we count on your support to refer promising start-ups in your markets to the Fund.

As always, we welcome your feedback on this publication and appreciate you sharing these stories with your network.

“With no formal background in education, data scientist talents turned to other fields. Academics are now trying to fill that void,” he said.

Algoritma, a startup company, was founded at the end of 2017 as the first data science academy in Indonesia.

Andreas Hadimulyono, a Grab warehouse engineer, pointed to mapping and traffic data that could be used to locate the best routes while using Grab’s transportation services.

“In this instance, we use data on locations, traffic and time. Even choosing a particular exit at one mall could make a difference in [deciding] which route to take. All of that is based on data,” he said.

JAKARTA, NNC - Despite just being inaugurated by Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi and Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Tuesday (3/20/2018), now about 15 startups from Singapore and Indonesia have started joining Nongsa Digital Park (NGP).

Indonesian Ambassador to Singapore Ngurah Swajaya on the sidelines of his working visit in Jakarta said there were 15 startups that joined but only three started operating there. One of the 15 startups that joined the NDP is a startup from Indonesia which is already operating in Singapore and is now joining in Nongsa, Batam.

""This is an attraction, there is collaboration between Indonesia and Singapore to attract startups from around the world to invest and collaborate there. More importantly, as said by Mrs. Foreign Minister, not only seen from the economic potential of two countries, but how to exploit the economic potential of ASEAN whose population reaches 600 million people,"" said Swajaya, Saturday (3/24).

He further said that the strong reason for developing the NDP in Batam is because of many human resources for the development of the digital economy, in addition to its proximity to Singapore.

As is known the movement of the digital economy of the world is gathering in Singapore, so if they know Batam has its human resources, facilities and infrastructure and the technology then this hope will open a gap for the development of a new economic sector, he said.

In 2017, Batam held a ""coding"" competition and from the selection of 518 participants who qualified 60 percent came from Batam. Most of them come from Batam Polytechnic and they developed financial technology, digital health and so on, said Swajaya.

The NDP built in Nongsa, Batam, on 166 hectares of land is one of the concrete forms of bilateral cooperation with Singapore agreed by President Joko Widodo and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the September 2017 meeting in Singapore.

The government is eyeing a $500 million investment in the digital and startup industry that is expected to open new work accelerations for 10,000 workers.

Swajaya said this also includes one form of cooperation of digital experts of Indonesia and Singapore. Various activities are carried out here such as ""training for trainers"", the reinforcement of human resources including for high school students to understand the future of the digital economy of the world."

The Indonesian government will also propose the liberalization of electronically-transmitted products from import duties. However, products that are traded online remain subjected to tax, she said.



To facilitate e-commerce and boost economic growth in the region ASEAN has initiated ASEAN Agreement on e-Commerce.



With regard to ASEAN Wide Self-Certification, Indonesia has proposed that the agreement should be put into force after all ASEAN member states have ratified it.



If any of the ASEAN member states has not ratified the agreement when it will be implemented, ASEAN will find it difficult to realize the mechanism because two different regulations will be needed, she said.

The 2nd UK Government International FinTech Conference will bring together international investors and UK Fintech firms alongside leading industry figures, regulators and policymakers for a day-long programme of talks and pitches promoting the opportunities for global investment in the UK Fintech sector.

In Wales the digital economy is worth an estimated £8.2bn and employs over 44,000 people.

Cardiff’s burgeoning reputation as an incubator for some of the UK’s leading FinTech companies will be highlighted at the conference by start-ups Wealthify, MYPINPAD and Delio.

Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns is currently exploring the growing potential for Wales-Asia trade links at the Great Festival of Innovation in Hong Kong.

Speaking of Wales’ growing stature in the FinTech sector, he said:

Whether you’re tapping your bank card to pay for your morning coffee, or using your smartphone to check your bank account in the evening, chances are you’re a regular consumer of Britain’s ambitious and exciting FinTech industries. This conference will be a showcase and a celebration of an industry that has done so much to contribute to this country’s knowledge, skills and expertise, enhancing the UK’s status as a global financial centre. And I’m delighted to see Welsh FinTech companies taking part today - each eager to showcase this impressive wave of innovation that Wales is producing, and each benefiting from a blueprint for the best FinTech ecosystem in the world, cultivated right here in the UK.

One of the Welsh companies invited to exhibit their technology at the conference is Wealthify. Launched in Cardiff in 2016, it is a low cost ‘robo’ investment service that makes the process of becoming an investor easier, quicker and more affordable.

Richard Theo, Chief Exective Officer of Wealthify said:

The International Fintech Conference is an exciting opportunity for some of the UK’s best and brightest fintech companies to come together through quality and relevant discussion, leading to meaningful collaboration with other businesses, policy makers and potential investors from around the globe. We are particularly impressed with the calibre of the other organisations on the attendee list of IFC2018, which reads like a ‘who’s who’ of the UK fintech sector. We launched Wealthify in 2016 with a mission to use technology to revolutionise and democratise investing by making it simple, affordable and accessible to everyone. Events such as IFC act as an important forum for like-minded Fintech businesses to meet, exchange experiences and ideas and take part in organic debate that helps drive progress in our emerging sectors. What really sets IFC aside from other events we’ve attended is the unique and invaluable opportunity to hold these vital discussions in the presence of Westminster policy and decision makers with whose support we can drive real and positive change for the UK sector and beyond.

Wealthify will be joined at the conference by MYPINPAD – a Cardiff based payment authentication software company established in 2012 which now has offices in London, Hong Kong and Jakarta.

Allan Syms, Chief Operating Officer at MyPinPad said:

We are delighted to have been hand selected to exhibit at this years’ International FinTech Conference as ‘one of the UK’s most exciting FinTech’s. MYPINPAD is a global leader in payments software authentication solutions. Our patented technologies make it easier and more secure than ever before for merchants and PSP’s to accept card payments both online and in-store to meet the ever-growing demand for innovative mobile payment solutions. Our aspiration of growing the number of global card acceptance points from 46m to 460m in the next 5 years drives us towards our goal of turning every ubiquitous smart device into a payment acceptance terminal. We are looking forward to showcasing our revolutionary software-based payments authentication technologies to international investors, industry experts and domestic policymakers at this year’s event.

The conference coincides with the launch of the UK Government’s FinTech Sector Strategy - a plan developed to underline the Government’s ongoing support for the industry, responding directly to one of the key aims of the Industrial Strategy of making the UK one of the best places to start and grow a business.

The Fintech Sector Strategy will include:

a Cryptoassets Task Force consisting of HM Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority. This will help the UK to be at the forefront of harnessing the potential benefits of the underlying technology, while guarding against potential risks

‘Robo-regulation’ pilot schemes to help new fintech firms, and the financial services industry more widely, comply with regulations by building software which would automatically ensure they follow the rules, saving them time and money

appointing three new Fintech Regional Envoys to ensure the benefits of fintech are felt across the UK

creating a set of industry standards which will enable fintech firms to more easily partner with existing banks

helping new, small fintech firms to provide complex financial services and thereby grow their businesses and reach new customers. Industry and government will work together to create ‘shared platforms’ which will help remove the barriers that these firms face in setting up new systems

a Connect with Work programme developed by the government’s Fintech Delivery Panel to help fintech firms to take advantage of the UK’s diverse workforce

At the conference the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, will also announce that Tech City UK is building a world-leading Fintech Programme across the country. This will support new companies in the sector across the UK to become tomorrow’s global fintech firms.

Digital and Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said:

We are determined to make Britain the best place to start and grow a digital business while giving consumers more choice when it comes to managing their money. This new nationwide fintech programme will help startups right across the country flourish in the future and spread the benefits of this pioneering technology.

The Conference is a highlight event as part of UK Fintech Week 2018, which takes place from 19-23 March. ENDS"

The weak ranking is particularly the result of the unconducive business environment and weak quality of Indonesia's human resources.

Jefri Sirait, Chairman of the Venture Capital Association for Indonesian Startups (Amvesindo), said Indonesia's ranking in ValuePenguin's research makes sense when matters such as the ease of business, the investment climate and quality of human resources are included. Hence, it is no surprise to see Singapore on top of the list. Moreover, Singapore has become the gateway for investment in the Southeast Asian region as well as the region's dominant startup hub due to its government's pro-business policies, ease of doing business and efficient tax regime (including tax incentives for startups).

Sirait also believes India is on the right track to become a hub for startups and venture capital as its government has been busy (since 2016) to improve the environment for startups and venture capital.

To those who want to invest in Indonesian startups, Sirait says investors need to be aware of the specific dynamics and unique context of the Indonesian market. For example, Indonesia's first unicorn Go-Jek - an Indonesian hyperlocal transport, logistics and payments startup - could not have become a success in Europe or South Korea.

Alibaba initially acquired a controlling stake in Singapore-based Lazada in 2016 for an investment valued at $1 billion, then increased its stake further with another $1 billion investment last year, raising its total to $4 billion.

Lazada operates online retail platforms across Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore and is the leading e-commerce provider in the region, with about 560 million consumers using the platform.

""With a young population, high mobile penetration and just 3% of the region's retail sales currently conducted online, we feel very confident to double down on Southeast Asia,"" said Lazada Chairwoman Lucy Peng, who will assume the additional role of chief executive. ""Lazada is well-positioned for the next phase of development of Internet-enabled commerce in this region.""

Online retail sales in China are off to a strong start for the year, creating upside potential for Alibaba. In August, Alibaba also invested $1.1 billion in Tokopedia, Indonesia's largest online marketplace.

Alibaba shares fell 2.9% to close at 194.53 on the stock market today.

On Feb. 2, Alibaba reported its fastest revenue growth in at least 15 quarters for its fiscal third quarter, but earnings fell short of estimates. Revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion.

Jakarta gets its first Alibaba Cloud data center for local startups

ALIBABA Cloud, the largest cloud computing company in China on Thursday opened the doors to its first data center in Jakarta, catering mainly to local startups as its parent company looks to outpace its international rivals in Asia’s emerging economies.

The opening in Jakarta is yet another move by Alibaba Group Holding to capture the region’s fast-growing tech market.

With the Jakarta center, the company says its clients can gain faster and more customized cloud services that meet local demands better compared to its US rivals like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.

Alibaba Cloud’s Asean, Australia, and New Zealand general manager Raymond Ma was quoted as saying that Alibaba Cloud is the first global player that has a local data center in Indonesia.

“From the latency and service quality perspective, we are probably better than vendors who have data centers outside of this country,” he told a press conference in Jakarta.

Cloud products

The company said the data center would offer a comprehensive suite of cloud products and services ranging from elastic computing, database service, networking, security and middleware to analytics and big data.

“This full range of Alibaba Cloud’s solutions will satisfy the surging needs of local enterprises across a range of industries including e-commerce, media, Fintech, gaming, logistics, transportation and manufacturing,” it said in a statement to Tech Wire Asia.

The company said its big data service called “MaxCompute”, a big data platform that allows users to store and process massive amounts of structural data to levels as high as terabyte or even petabyte. It will also bring sophisticated data intelligence services such as data processing, analytics and machine learning to Indonesian businesses, empowering data-driven innovation and business transformation.

“As the only global cloud services provider originating from Asia, we are uniquely positioned with cultural and contextual advantages to provide innovative data intelligence solutions and computing capabilities to customers across this region,” said Alex Li, General Manager of Asia Pacific, Alibaba Cloud.

The launch of the data center is part of Alibaba Cloud’s ongoing commitment to support the Indonesian government’s initiative to create 1,000 startups by 2020.

For SMEs and startups, access to scalable and affordable cloud services are essential to accelerate their growth.

The company said by migrating IT infrastructure to Alibaba Cloud, these growing firms can leverage the available powerful cloud services to scale rapidly, accelerate innovation and reduce cost.

“They can expand their geographic reach through Alibaba Cloud’s established global network to support international operations and better compete in global trade,” the company said."

The cloud computing arm of Alibaba is focusing on serving SMEs in particular, including startups. The new data center is a part of Alibaba Cloud’s initiative of supporting the Indonesian Government in creating 1000 startups by 2020.

By migrating IT infrastructure to Alibaba Cloud, these growing firms can leverage the available cloud services to scale rapidly and reduce cost.

Additionally, they can expand their geographic reach through Alibaba Cloud’s established global network to support international operations and better compete in global trade.

In order to incubate a local internet-related ecosystem, Alibaba Cloud also announced that it will bring the Alibaba Cloud Certified Professional (ACP) program to Indonesia.

Within a year, Alibaba Cloud expects to train 300 and certify 100 cloud-skilled professionals in Indonesia with its program, providing both entrepreneurs and local talent with knowledge regarding current and emerging technology in cloud computing, big data and security.

Head of Alibaba Cloud ASEAN & ANZ, Raymond Ma says Alibaba Cloud is dedicated to making its technology as inclusive as possible within the markets we operate.

“By providing a full range of cutting edge cloud solutions and combining this with our expertise, we can assist Indonesian SMEs, government, and enterprises to integrate advanced cloud technology into their daily operations to drive innovation and thrive in the digital age,” adds Ma.

Alibaba Cloud has already help a number of Indonesian internet companies to innovate their business on cloud, including Tokopedia, GTech Digital Asia, Dwidaya Tour, and Yogrt.

The Indonesia data center adds to Alibaba Cloud’s data centers in 17 regions worldwide.

Alibaba Cloud’s general manager of Asia Pacific, Alex Li says Alibaba Cloud is the only global cloud services provider originating from Asia, giving the company a unique position with cultural advantages to provide innovative data intelligence solutions and computing capabilities.

The vibrant and lively Indonesia holds more than just a dense population. Being a melting pot of cultures, the country offers multiple markets to address.

INGRM Guide to Jakarta Startups to help Indonesian professionals who are shifting towards building their own tech-based business, as well as foreign startup founders who are eyeing Indonesia as their next market for expansion. Photo courtesy of Pexels/NOW!JAKARTA

Home to around 260 million people, it goes without saying that Indonesia faces numerous local pain-points. To startups, however, these pain-points serve as untapped opportunities, meaning that growth opportunities are still widely available for Indonesian startups and foreign startups that are entering the market.

Driven by the hunger for insiders’ insights, my team and I dug deep into the ecosystem and generated tips directly from the real players and leaders in the industry. Having interviewed more than 30 tech industry players and venture capitalists across Indonesia, we present INGRM Guide to Jakarta Startups to help Indonesian professionals who are shifting towards building their own tech-based business, as well as foreign startup founders who are eyeing Indonesia as their next market for expansion.

Being born into the VC ecosystem, I had the privilege to cross paths with many of Indonesia’s top startup ecosystem players. From entrepreneurs and investors to the government and media supporting the industry, I got to learn a big part of their journeys in building and and sustaining meaningful businesses. Inspired by what they had experienced, I decided to share a compilation of this information and insights for a book and think of it as a starter package for anyone who needs to know more about the startup climate in Jakarta.

INGRM Guide to Jakarta Startups is targeted at those who are interested in joining the entrepreneurship race in this so-called unique market. In the form of a direct experience storytelling, 30 prominent Southeast Asian industry leaders shared their market-tested lessons on how to start and sustain meaningful businesses in Indonesia. Featuring 13 chapters formatted as steps to starting a business, from finding the right co-founders to fundraising and protecting IP rights, this guide includes insights you won’t find in other books or classes. In addition, the INGRM Guide provides information on co-working spaces, programmes, events and investors in Jakarta that the readers can consider as their approach strategy to the market.

Indonesia’s startups are looking at a very rapid growth. One major contributing factor is the mobile and Internet penetration rate, with calculations that the number of Internet users in Indonesia has reached 112 million (end of 2017), making Indonesia the sixth largest country in terms of Internet usage. A research conducted by Google and AT Kearney reveals that Indonesian startup investment has grown 60 times in just five years. Having received US$ 3.1 billion in investment in 2017, Indonesia has proven to be the fastest-growing center of attention as it leads Southeast Asia’s tech industry, trailing only behind Singapore.

Aside from generating knowledge and insights into Jakarta’s startup ecosystem, I hope for the guide to boost the confidence of those who want to start their venture in Jakarta, finding inspiration and the necessary connections in the book. While nowadays a wide range of information can easily be accessed online, it may be a bit harder to come across insights, such as the ones shared by industry leaders who have successful businesses in Jakarta and contributed to this guidebook with direct advice, shared specifically for those who are starting out as entrepreneurs in Jakarta.

The process of compiling the book was an exhilarating journey for the team, especially when the industry leaders began to open up and showed us their side of the story. It was also an amazing opportunity to learn that the different sides of the ecosystem are coming together as a network: they help each other thrive and lend a helping hand to the newcomers who in their eyes will be a further benefit to the nation.

""The Surabaya name is already well known in ASEAN and Asia but not yet [famous] in most European countries. This is the right momentum,"" Tri Rismaharini said in Surabaya on Sunday (3/11/2018).

According to her, the 2018 Startup Nation Summit will look different from it was in previous years, because the City Government of Surabaya is planning to package the event with the today's atmosphere dubbed Innovation Creative industry.

Risma said the Startup Nation Summit event which will be attended by 183 delegates from various countries will be collaborated with digital creative industry event. So it's not just an activity as usual, but will be flavored with digital and millennial atmosphere. The innovation creative event presents several agenda such as digital art, community activity, virtual reality, interactive games, innovation zone workshop and music performance.

""[We] deliberately present many agendas so that all ages could join in the event. We target one million visitors,"" she said.

Another reason, Risma incorporated a creative digital agenda to realize Surabaya as the first creative city in Indonesia, advancing the startup world of Surabaya and bringing this city to the world map.

In addition, she added, the city administration also promotes this event through several ways among others, promotional media, mass mobilization, billboards, flyers in schools, buses, villages and will feature in videotron (large screen).

326;737221020;20180309;2018;http://sea-globe.com/why-banks-and-fintech-startups-are-naturally-interdependent/;"Fintech startups once wanted to replace banks and now they want to work with them, but the manner of this relationship remains to be seen

A few years ago, when startups began using technology to offer financial services to customers at a fraction of the costs charged by banks, Bill Gates’ observation in 1994 that while “banking is essential, banks are not” seemed eerily prescient. Amazon had already revolutionised the retail industry and Facebook and Google how we communicate and consume information. Fintech startups dreamed of doing the same to banking. But reams of red tape mean that many will struggle to make those dreams a reality.

“The regulators are basically owned by the banks and their friends,” said Steve Landman, CEO of Kiu Asia, a Vietnam-based firm that develops software that automates a company’s back-end processes. “There’s no incentive for them to create regulation that’s going to change things so that digital finance becomes the main way of moving money around.”

Only 25 out of the world’s roughly 5,000 fintech startups have reached the ‘unicorn’ status of a $1 billion market valuation, according to a 2016 report by venture capital firm Life.Sreda. Fintech companies have since acknowledged that they need to work with banks in order to enjoy success on a large scale.

However, the relationship is not all one-way traffic. Banks realise that customers using tellers at physical branches to send money from one account to another is not an efficient use of their infrastructure. They will cooperate with fintech companies that develop technologies that reduce the operational costs of such transactions, but only if it helps them jump ahead of the competition, according to Sothearoath Oeur, the interim CEO of Credit Bureau Cambodia.

“Some [financial] institutions want to keep control of their database and will develop their own fintech solutions, but one of the limitations is that it can be quite time consuming. Another question concerns their staff’s capability to [create solutions],” he said. “New fintech startups want to cooperate with the banks; the question becomes: how can they open the door to collaboration? The clear message they need to bring to the financial institutions is that they are not here to take over the whole process.”

327;736928273;20180308;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/17582/indonesia/banks-fintech-indonesia/;"Fintech startups have some key advantages over banks: they can move fast and react to trends, experiment with new technologies and processes, and work on small budgets.Banks, on the other hand, know how to navigate regulations and obtain licenses required to operate in the industry. They have a large client base and access to infrastructure and resources.

In Indonesia, banks have used this argument to suggest that collaboration between banks and startups is the best way forward to solve pressing problems such financial inclusion. Some of Indonesia’s large banks have programs through which they interact with startups.

These include incubation programs, events, and funding. Most of these have only started in the last one or two years, so it’s too early to comment on outcomes. Indonesia has over 100 banks, targeting different segments and needs, most of them have been slow to react to the changing technology landscape.

Incubation programs and events where startups and bank executives can learn from each other also don’t solve the problem of true collaboration, where banks and startups work together on products that are beneficial to both of them.

One example is escrow or cash management products for p2p lending, suggests Ajisatria Suleiman, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Fintech Association.

“The regulation is quite specific on how the escrow should work, and banks that provide better escrow services would attract more engagement from p2p lending players.”

Another way banks can create meaningful interaction with startups is providing access to data through open APIs. In practice, fintech startups lament, banks are still falling short when it comes to meaningful collaboration with startups. After first meetings,

While it’s become easier to get introductions and arrange meetings, fintech founders say follow-up tends to be slow for multiple reasons. Banks are generally slow-moving, which means processes just take longer. Other common reasons for delays are fear of compliance issues and other risks. Some founders speculate that banks don’t see a business case in working with fintech startups whose user base is still relatively small.

On a more positive note, the Indonesian Central Bank has setup a Fintech Office towards the end of 2016 to simplify communication with fintech startups where they can advise and query about regulations.

Here’s a look at what banks have done to connect with fintech startups in Indonesia.

Bank Mandiri

Indonesia’s largest state-owned bank offers the most comprehensive program for startups.

In early 2016, Mandiri became the first local bank to launch a dedicated fintech venture fund, Mandiri Capital (MCI), with a US$37 million budget. It has financed startups like card reader startup Cashlez, micro-lender Amartha, and point-of-sales software Moka.

Mandiri Capital together with state-owned telco Telkom also runs the Mandiri Business Incubator to help fintech startups find their feet. The bank also hosts regular fintech events such as Finspire and a Hackathon series. It has opened the API to its e-money system Mandiri E-Cash for startups to experiment with.

Bank Central Asia

BCA is the country’s largest private bank. It launched its venture fund, Central Capital Ventura (CCV) in early 2017. The initial fund sits at about US$15 million. CCV hasn’t made its investments official yet, but is said to have participated in the funding of lending platform KlikACC.

BCA has a website with several APIs for developers to tap into.

Bank Bukopin

Bank Bukopin, a which targets SMEs and Indonesia’s middle segment, launched startup incubator called BnV Labs in March last year. Startups in the program can use office space at BnV Lab’s partner co-working space, Kibar. Participants get mentorship and can get access to the bank’s ecosystem.

Bank Rakyat Indonesia

Instead of setting up its own investment arm, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), which caters to small scale entrepreneurs, acquired a 35% stake in a venture capital firm called Bahana Artha Ventura and says it will finance fintech startups through this vehicle. It hasn’t announced any investments yet.

Anywhere in Jakarta, visitors find a sea of Go-jek jackets and helmets on motorbikes. In front of any shopping mall or office tower, drivers cluster up in groups, chatting with each other as they wait for passengers.

Go-jek drivers pick up passengers in front of a shopping mall in downtown Jakarta

Visitors to Jakarta often wonder what Go-jek is and why its signature green colour pervades this 10-million city. After a bit of research, it becomes clear that Go-jek is Indonesia’s most successful startup, offering a wide range of ride-sharing and delivery services across 50 cities in the country.

The green colour of Go-jek is everywhere on Jakarta's streets

Jazzy Refadebby, a 30-year-old marketing manager, told VIR that everyone uses Go-jek because it is reliable, cheap, and convenient. The Jakarta resident herself uses Go-jek almost every day for transportation and delivery.

More than a ride-hailing app

Go-jek’s success story is quite a fairy tale. In merely seven years of operation, the startup has grown into a $3-billion business backed by high-profile investors like BlackRock, Tencent, and Google.

It is noteworthy that while competitors Grab and Uber offer mostly passenger transport, Go-jek has expanded its services to goods transport, food delivery, and even massage or beauty services, making it an indispensable part of daily life in Jakarta.

Drivers waiting in the rain for passengers

To Jakarta residents, Go-jek provides much needed relief to commuting in the bustling capitol. And it is not just any city—Jakarta is internationally known for traffic jams. Statistics show that drivers here can only go at 8.3 kilometre per hour, half of the figure for New York City.

Apparently, Jakarta residents know that hailing a Go-jek motorbike is faster and more convenient than being stuck in their own car during a traffic gridlock. According to Refadebby, most people in Jakarta live far from their office, making daily commute a nightmare.

“There are just too many traffic jams, everyone is tired of driving on their own so ride-hailing is a great option,” she said.

A long list of services that Go-jek offers, according to its website

According to Go-jek, its smartphone app has been downloaded 22 million times in Indonesia, and about 400,000 Go-jek drivers ride motorbikes, cars, and trucks to pick up passengers or goods for delivery on a daily basis.

Debut in Vietnam

A week ago, it was reported that the Indonesian firm is prepping its debut in Vietnam as part of the plan to go regional. Go-jek is also eyeing the Philippines, having said that it will launch in the country this year.

It is interesting to see how Go-jek will fare in Vietnam. Unlike in Jakarta, where it has the local and early-bird advantage, Go-jek will have to face the challenge of being a late-comer in the fast-growing market of more than 93 million people.

It is interesting to see how Go-jek will fare in Vietnam. Unlike in Jakarta, where it has the local and early-bird advantage, Go-jek will have to face the challenge of being a late-comer in the fast-growing market of more than 93 million people.

In particular, residents in big Vietnamese cities are already frequent customers of Grab and Uber, two of the world’s largest ride-hailing apps with networks in various countries. Other domestic players such as 123xevivu, Gonow or Mai Linh Bike are also trying to break into the scene, making Vietnam a tough battlefield for Go-jek.

That said, the Indonesian firm has good money under its belt:as it raised $1.5 billion (or 25 per cent more than it intended) last year and recently secured another $150 million from Indonesian conglomerate Astra International.

Go-jek is also planning to list on the Indonesian Stock Exchange to raise capital.

With such ample funds, it looks like the Indonesian startup is ready for the battle in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.

But no matter how Go-jek does in international markets, every day in Jakarta, thousands of its drivers will still continue to zip through the city, helping to solve the city’s traffic issues in their green armor. In this city, Go-jek may have become a landmark itself."

It would mark the first major liquidity event for the 8-year-old company that has been shoring up cash to battle its US-based rival Uber The selling shareholders include angel investor Rehan Yar Khan and the investors who got stocks in Ola after its acquisition of Taxiforsure in 2015, said the people aware of the matter. These investors include venture firms Accel India, Bessemer Venture Partners, Helion Venture Partners and the Taxiforsure founders Aprameya Radhakrishna and Raghunandan G. These firms have mandated a local investment bank and the secondary block is pegged at $150 million for a stake of more than 5%.Negotiations for the secondary transaction are being held in parallel with the talks for the primary stake, and both the deals are likely to be done together so the incoming investor would gain a sizable stake in the company, the sources said.Spokespersons for both Ola and Temasek said that they “do not comment on market speculation.” Ola was last valued at $4 billion when it raised $400 million from Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent in September. While sources close to Ola say it has a 65-70% market share, Uber insists it has closed the market gap in terms of cab rides.An investment by Temasek, which is also an investor in Uber’s Southeast Asia rival Grab , could help Ola turn up pressure on Uber, which has to cut losses before an initial public offering of its shares next year.Japanese internet giant Soft-Bank, Ola’s largest backer since 2014, recently also became the largest shareholder in Uber, sparking speculation of a merger or acquisition of the US company’s Indian operations with Ola. One round of discussions took place between the two companies but the talks did not progress, although it is possible that a fresh round might take place in June, said a person familiar with the developments.On a recent visit to India, Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company sees India “as a core market” and will continue investing aggressively here. “I don’t want to categorically state or characterise any discussions that we may or may not be having. What I will categorically state — I consider India a core market and we are going to be investing in India and growing here for a long time,” he told ET when asked about a potential merger with Ola.A spokesperson for Uber declined to comment on the matter. Uber’s global loss jumped 61% to $4.5 billion in 2017, with aggressive investments in India and Southeast Asia being one of the main reasons. A CNBC report in the US last month said Uber was in the process of selling its Southeast Asia business to Grab, which is also backed by SoftBank, for a stake in the Indonesian company.Ola recently began operations in Australia, where Uber dominates, with much lower commission rates of 7.5% for drivers as compared to 20% charged there by Uber. Both Uber and Ola cut their operating losses or cash burn rates in 2017 as they pared driver and customer incentives.Gross booking value of companies in the local ride-sharing space increased to $2.1 billion in 2017 from $1.5 billion in the year before, show data from consulting firm Redseer. About 85% of the market is in the cab-booking space but other segments have started to grow. The share of auto-rickshaws in this market doubled to 4% in 2017, while the share of pooled rides increased to 11% from 7%.(With inputs from Shashwati Shankar)
333;735859441;20180305;2018;https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/profiles/simon-and-lani-te-hennepe-travel-startup-travlr-simple-pdf-document/;"Simon and Lani te Hennepe’s travel startup TRAVLR operates across six countries, has over 85 staff, and has raised $5 million in venture capital. But nine years ago, the startup existed only as a single PDF document.

It started as a simple thought: Lani, a seasoned Bali traveller, was planning her and Simon’s first trip to the island together, and was taking notes on different bargains for hotel and restaurant prices.

“I remember her telling me this hotel was $300 bucks a night online, but she knew if you rang them up and bartered with them, you could get it for $100,” Simon te Hennepe tells StartupSmart.

“We thought ‘people should know this’, and it all stemmed from there.”

Those notes became a PDF document — a scripture shared with close friends and relatives that quickly gained notoriety. Hundreds of people were asking for it, so the pair created a Facebook page that went from two followers to 10,000 in a matter of weeks.

Then it became a website, then a mobile app. By that point, it was no longer curating just the te Hennepe’s experiences but collating experiences from thousands of other travellers, letting them make their own Bali Bible and create shareable, personal trips.

Now the Bali Bible sits under the wider business of TRAVLR, with users able to book entire curated trips through the startup’s website. The startup is profitable, has nearly 2 million social media followers, and is already in the midst of seeking a Series B capital injection, just six months after completing a $5 million Series A.

But the te Hennepe’s success required numerous hard yards, and even harder decisions.

A path less TRAVL’d

Simon te Hennepe says he began his journey in the startup industry when he was just 15, starting a personal training business and even employing a few personal trainers before diving into a career leading product marketing and business development teams at companies like 1form and Fillr.

“I always knew I wanted to do my own thing, and I was always forcing my way up as an entrepreneur. Even when I was working in various different businesses full-time I still viewed it as a solution for the interim until I got where I wanted to be,” he says.

The Bali Bible and TRAVLR haven’t been te Hennepe’s only venture over the years, but he willingly admits they’ve been his most successful. The co-founder previously established a number of other ventures, including a web development company and a sunglasses company, along with some other failed projects (he briefly mentions a social media referral platform he admits was one of the “lot of things I’ve done that failed”).

“I’ve been aggressively driven my whole life, and I’ve always wanted to be in this situation as a founder, creating something that disrupts an industry,” he says.

“I just didn’t think a PDF document would be the one to do it.”

To be fair, labelling the Bali Bible ‘just a PDF document’ is a significant undersell. The startup grew rapidly beyond a list of recommendations quite quickly and it began to suck up most of the te Hennepes’ time.

Entirely bootstrapped from the founders’ income from their full-time jobs, the Bali Bible started as a hobby and a side project, reflected in the fact they “didn’t make a cent from it for the first three years”, laughs te Hennepe.

“We’d work all day at our jobs and then get home at 5pm and work on the company until midnight, replying to emails from users asking about where they should go on their trips. We outsourced development to India, which meant I sometimes had late night calls at two or three o’clock,” he says.

“It was a labour of love, but we knew there was potential to monetise it down the track.”

As they progressed, the money began to roll in, and the startup became more and more self-sustaining, and eventually profitable. At the start of 2015, five years on from the official ‘launch’ of the Bali Bible, te Hennepe says the business was in an amazing place, profitable and running smoothly — a perfect moment to tip everything on its head.

Te Hennepe says it sounded like a crazy idea at the time, taking all the money they had made (and even some they hadn’t) and pouring it into a new entity TRAVLR — an unknown, but one with the potential to become something much bigger than the business they had.

“Lani asked why we’d take something we’d been doing every day for five years and we were finally making a profit on and risk it all on something new,” te Hennepe says.

“She said to me, ‘you’re an idiot, but I’ll back you’, and that was a make or break moment for us. It was either rest on our laurels and sit on what we had for the next five years or whatever, or risk it all and go for the big goal.”

The two remortgaged their house, employed development teams across the world, and fell back into working to midnight every night. The business was “hemorrhaging money”, and te Hennepe laughs that he was “in the bad books” for a year-and-a-half.

“We now look back, and it was such a ride and we learnt so much. We were working full-time and every cent went back into the business, and it was only after a year-and-a-half of doing that did we realise we had made the right decision,” he says.

“We’d be somewhere else entirely if we didn’t go down this path.”

On how TRAVLR leveraged social media

TRAVLR raises $5 million

Towards the end of last year, TRAVLR closed a $5 million Series A funding round from an array of New Zealand based investors, including Humphry Rolleston, Peter Guthrey and Grant Moreton. Te Hennepe says he had been involved in Series A processes with previous businesses so he had experience in the area, but it still required a lot of legwork.

The startup got more interest from more parties than the founders were expecting — an unusual feeling for te Hennepe who says he’s usually “begging” people to invest in his ideas.

“We got to pick and choose, and that’s never happened to me before,” he says.

But the two wanted more than just capital, looking for investors who could give them networks and business experience. They landed on the group of New Zealand investors that te Hennepe says have over 120 years of travel industry experience collectively.

“My view was the better our investors’ experience, the increasing potential for use to be the next TripAdvisor,” he says.

Startup founders who focus more on the capital rather than the investors themselves are going down the wrong path, he says, with experience being “worth its weight in gold”. But te Hennepe recognises TRAVLR might have been in a unique experience, saying not every startup founder can pick and choose.

“It’s hard to say to people they should pick and choose their investors because not many people are in that very fortunate position to be selective like we were. That’s where your relationships and networks play a massive factor,” he says.

The startup has also recently hired two executives: a chief operating officer in Geoff Stringer, who has experience working at Lonely Planet and Sensis; and a chief technical officer in Stuart Rowe, who also worked at 1Form and Fillr.

Te Hennepe is very excited about the recent hires as TRAVLR moves forward, and says that staffing has always been a difficult task for the startup but the team he has now is “just amazing”

“Someone told me years ago to find the right person, and fill the role around them, build them into a specific role. We’ve gone about it in that manner and we’ve always found the right people who fit the company and share our vision,” he says.

The company is now looking to future expansion, with TRAVLR’s service offerings soon to be launched in Seychelles, Indonesia, the Cook Islands, and New Zealand.

“It’s been a crazy journey, and we’re already in Series B conversations. We want to be in 20 countries, and we’ve already got tourism boards fighting for us and our technology,” he says.

“I never thought we’d be here today.”

Of the 36 companies, 34 operate in Greater Jakarta, while the remaining two are situated in Surabaya, East Java, and Ternate in North Maluku, according to the acting commissioner of OJK’s non-bank financial industry supervisory department, M. Ihsanuddin as reported by kompas.com.

He added that 21 companies were supported by domestic investors, while 15 companies sourced their capital from foreign investors.

Another 42 fintech companies have expressed interest in registering with the OJK.

Ihsanuddin conceded that it was difficult for the OJK to identify the exact number of fintech companies operating in the country.

“So, Indonesia could have more fintech companies,” he said, adding that the amount of loans disbursed by these firms reached Rp 3 trillion (US$218.1 million) as of January, a 17 percent increase from the same period last year. (bbn)"
335;735912293;20180305;2018;https://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/todays-headlines/what-were-indonesia-s-most-popular-e-commerce-platforms-in-2017/item8635;"In line with rising Internet and smartphone penetration across Indonesia, the modern Indonesian consumer is increasingly buying products online. Another important factor is that Indonesia's huge population (260 million individuals) is young and therefore easily adapts to a modern, online lifestyle. Meanwhile, Better Than Cash Alliance, a partnership consisting of governments, companies, and international organizations, released a report last year stating that Indonesia has become the world's fastest-growing mobile-commerce market (m-commerce).

It does mean, however, that competition between e-commerce platforms is becoming increasingly fierce in Southeast Asia's largest economy.

Based on research conducted by iPrice, Lazada was the most popular e-commerce platform in Indonesia in 2017. Lazada managed to receive an average of 131.8 million visitors per month, followed by Tokopedia with 115.3 million visitors per month.

It is interesting to note that both Lazada and Tokopedia received a capital injection from China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2017. While Alibaba strengthened its grip on the Southeast Asian e-commerce market by investing USD $1 billion in Lazada in mid-2017, it invested USD $1.1 billion in Tokopedia in August 2017. Hence, Alibaba now has a very strong presence in Indonesia's e-commerce market, something which may encourage the flow of Chinese products into Indonesia.

Meanwhile, iPrice also states that four e-commerce platforms in Indonesia are now valued above USD $1 billion: Lazada, Tokopedia, Bukalapak and Shopee. However, only Tokopedia and Bukalapak are Indonesian unicorns because they are headquartered in Indonesia (while Lazada and Shopee are headquartered in Singapore).

Over the past year Shopee has been rising rapidly in Indonesia. Based on a report from Shopee's parent company Sea Ltd, the gross merchandise value of Shopee reached USD $4.1 billion in full-year 2017, up three-fold from the preceding year. Meanwhile, 40 percent of its gross merchandise value stems from Indonesia.

What explains the rapid development of Indonesia's e-commerce industry?

Indonesia contains a huge population numbering more than 260 million people. In combination with rising per capita GDP and purchasing power this population forms a huge consumer force





Indonesia's middle class segment continues to expand. To determine the exact number of middle class consumers in Indonesia is a matter of definition. Using a low bar (as used by Boston Consulting Group or McKinsey) Indonesia has 45-75 million middle class and affluent consumers. Institutions that set a higher bar say Indonesia has less than 20 million middle class consumers. However, all institutions expect the number of middle class consumers to rise rapidly in the years and decades to come





Smartphone penetration is rising in Indonesia. Based on data from research institute eMarketer there were 69.4 million smartphone users in Indonesia at the end of 2016. Moreover, this figure is expected to grow to 103 million by 2018, which would make Indonesia the fourth-largest smartphone market worldwide after China, India and the United States





Internet penetration is rising in Indonesia. According to the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (in Indonesian: Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia, abbreviated APJII) there are currently 132.7 million Internet users in Indonesia. With the government's Palapa Ring project under construction this figure will rise steeply in the years ahead





Online shopping - as well as other online activities (such as social media or gaming) - is a popular activity among the Indonesian population because Indonesia has a young population (hence more interested in digital technology and more able to adapt it into their lives). Moreover, a characteristic of Indonesia's young population is that it likes to purchase the newest ""trending"" products

Executives led by Go-Jek President Andre Soelistyo met with officials from the Indonesia Stock Exchange in Jakarta on Monday to discuss an IPO, Tito Sulistio, the bourse’s president, told reporters. While the company is “very serious” about the IPO, there was no specific timeframe, Soelistyo said in a text message.

Go-Jek, with backers including Google and KKR & Co., has evolved from an app to book ride-sharing on motorbikes to a way to pay bills, order food, organize a makeover and buy movie tickets. The company recently raised funds from investors including Google, Temasek Holdings Pte and PT Astra International and was valued at $1.8 billion by CB Insights in 2016.

The company is keen on a Jakarta listing as it would allow Indonesians, including its drivers, an opportunity to own the shares, Soelistyo said.

Go-Jek may also be considering a dual listing to allow foreign investors buy into the company, the exchange’s Sulistio said. Go-Jek will be allowed to sell shares even if it’s unprofitable as long as the company is able to project future profits, he said.

Chief Executive Officer Nadiem Makarim told Bloomberg’s Year Ahead Asia Conference in December that the IPO is expected “hopefully within the next few years.”

Makarim’s goal is to let his customers pay for coffee, groceries, tickets and other things outside the realms of the startup’s services.

The company, led by CEO Amit Saberwal, brings together budget hotel owners under the RedDoorz banner and books their rooms via an online marketplace. Through the site, hotel owners get access to guests, and travelers can rest assured that RedDoorz-branded hotel rooms have clean sheets, decent internet, and trained staff.

The company launched in Indonesia, before using earlier funding rounds to expand to the Philippines and Singapore, where the company just leased its own hotel to run. In an interview with CNBC, Saberwal said the company is hoping to tap into Southeast Asia’s $52 billion travel market by fulfilling an unmet need—offering hotel rooms to young, domestic travelers.

Investors must like what they see, because the so-called pre-Series A funding round was a success thanks to existing investors like Sushquehanna International Group. Meanwhile, World Bank’s International Finance Corporation teamed up with a handful of newcomers, like DeepSky Capital and FengHe Group. The new cash will let the company expand operations into new cities and new countries, including Thailand, where there are undoubtedly plenty of young travelers looking for budget hotel rooms."

“Mobile applications also offer an opportunity for market players to connect with customers as well as a personalised shopping experience,” Mishra further added.

According to Frost & Sullivan’s Quarterly E-Commerce Market Program, Q4 2017 update released in February 2018, Indonesia contributed to over one third of the SEA E-Commerce market (in terms of GMV), whereas other markets in the region with the exception of Thailand contributed double digits numbers. Thailand’s B2C e-commerce market size is less than half of Indonesia.

During Q4 2017, retailers introduced a number of popular marketing campaigns to attract consumers to spend more during the year-end festive season. These include Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales as well as the traditional Christmas and year end flash sales. These activities drove sales and resulted in higher traffic on their websites and/ or mobile applications.

According to Mr. Avinash Sachdeva, Principal Analyst, ICT Research at Frost & Sullivan Asia-Pacific, retailers should also not underestimate the potential of the emerging economies on the E-Commerce sector.

“Emerging economies in the region are unlocking digital opportunities for market players as they enhance mobile platforms to improve customer experience,” explained Sachdeva.

Notes:

In the context of this research Frost & Sullivan defines “E-Commerce” as the sale of goods via an online medium which have been traditionally purchased via physical retail medium. The research excludes electronic sales of:

Travel and holiday packages

Tickets sale related to travel (air, rail and road) and events (sports, music concerts, etc.)

Revenue generated by online gambling sites

App store purchases, online gaming services and in-app purchases on such platforms.

Ride hailing services and delivery of foods, magazines, household goods, and DVD rentals.

The research study primarily focuses on Business to Consumer (B2C) market, however the coverage includes individual sellers transacting on the e-commerce marketplaces such as Shopee, Lazada, Bukalapak and others. It excludes Person to Person (P2P) platforms (Mudah, OLX etc.) which primarily lists products and where the transaction does not conclude on the platform. Any revenue reported outside of the definition mentioned here is not part of the Frost & Sullivan’s numbers reported here.

BPS Releases Indonesia E-Commerce Data

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Central Statistics Agency (BPS) will release general overview data or research on e-commerce in Indonesia. BPS Head Suhariyanto said the research is still underway by involving the users.

“Wait until March, it is still being collected. The point is that e-commerce users are very enthusiastic to participate,” he said at the Book Launching of Creative Economic Statistics on Tuesday, February 27.

According to Suhariyanto, the enthusiasm is also due to the data which will be useful for the players in the industry, not only for the government.

Suhariyanto added, until now, Indonesia does not have the exact data associated with e-commerce. In fact, the data is needed to read the shift of consumers' preferences, products which purchased online, until the possibility of other shift that needs to be anticipated.

He said that it will affect the economy which is leading to the digital economy.

Suhariyanto said the data collected from the e-commerce users through the marketplace platform has not included the trading or sales on social media.

342;734249058;20180227;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/17232/indonesia/why-is-indonesias-payments-landscape-so-fragmented/;"Indonesia is slowly moving away from its dependency on cash as startups, banks, and telcos alike are all introducing new types of card-based and mobile money.

Some of them are forcing consumers into their ecosystems. For example, the country made it mandatory to pay for toll roads with e-cash cards at automated gates.

Five different types of cards are accepted at these toll gates, including Bank Mandiri’s E-Money card and and Bank BCAs Flazz. Mandiri and BCA are Indonesia’s two largest banks.

In some malls, paying for parking requires downloading a mobile wallet app. Visitors have complained about getting stuck in a mall parking lot because they had trouble installing the app that’s mandatory to pay there. Consumers are forced to stock up on multiple cards and wallets if they want to use a variety of services.

Fintech News spoke with Smartpesa’s CTO Thorsten Neumann, who is a long-time observer of payments systems in the African continent and Asia, about his perspective on Indonesia’s payments landscape. Smartpesa is a white-label payments service that partners with Visionet in Indonesia, a subsidiary of the Lippo Group conglomerate.

Why do we see this growing fragmentation in the Indonesian payments ecosystem?

The issuer side is fragmenting because technology barriers are breaking down. New licenses, such e-money licenses, are being issued. The pie is huge and everybody is chasing it.

If each has a few million users, it makes it worthwhile. Each also plays to a specific demographic of market segment. The upper end does not use mobile money, the lower income group does not use credit cards.

Who are the most relevant players in Indonesia?

Some of the popular cashless payment options are debit card systems like BCA Paspor, and other local debit cards networks such as Prima, Alto, and Artajasa. There are card-based e-money solutions like Flazz and Mandiri, and mobile wallets like OVO and Go-Jek.

What’s important for the success of new payments solution?

Right now, it’s mostly about marketing. Anybody with funding and deep pockets can create their own standard, like contactless, or QR code, and sign up the most customers. The platform with most users wins because of critical mass.

Investors are spending heavily to win customers. For users of the OVO wallet (which belongs to Lippo Group) parking is only Rp 1 at Lippo parking lots. Grab offers $3 discount on meals, and $5 discount on the next taxi booking just for using GrabPay. Consumers run after the deals, but as soon as the deals stop, usage drops.

What’s the point of creating a payment system that locks customers into its particular silo?

When we still had a low connectivity environment, before the internet, it was simply not a question. Cash was king because it’s accepted everywhere. Now that we going digital, we are shaking up the system. There is no government-set standard or blueprint for interoperability, everybody makes their own standard, protocol, format.

An example is BCA’s Flazz card. BCA copied EMV (the global standard used by Mastercard and Visa) contactless almost perfectly, but they made it proprietary.

VISA, MasterCard, JCB, AmEx all agreed that contactless should be universal across all cards. Hence, we have PayWave, and PayPass that work interchangeably on a payment terminal.

But not Flazz. It’s similar, but BCA did not want to make it compatible, so they force merchants to have their special terminals for Flazz, or sometimes require cumbersome proprietary software development to make a terminal accept EMV contactless and Flazz.

Why did BCA do this? To capture the market, and prevent competition, to own the payment without sharing the infrastructure.

What needs to happen to achieve greater interoperability?

This can only change with top down authoritarian mandated standards.

An example of mandated standards is Indonesian NSICCS (National Standard Indonesian Chip Card Specification), a national standard defined by the Indonesian Central Bank (Bank Indonesia) l

st year and which is being implemented in phases over the coming years.

It’s the card standard to ensure all banks and all cards work on all terminals at all merchants. Customers then don’t need to worry that a merchant does not accept their card.

What are the downsides of a highly fragmented payments landscape?

I see fragmentation as a problem, because if im poorer, and have limited income, every transaction costs money. Now instead of putting my money into Bank A, building up credit history to financing my car, and so on, the underbanked individual ends up spreading their money across many different platforms. $20 in OVO, $10 in T-Money (which belongs to Indonesia’s state-owned Telko, Telkom), and each have high fees.

Hyperloop Transportation Technologies on Thursday announced an agreement with an Ohio agency to launch a study on creating its first interstate hyperloop project in the U.S., connecting Chicago and Cleveland.

The agreement with the Northern Ohio Area Coordinating Committee puts in motion a regional feasibility study, to be carried out in conjunction with the Illinois Department of Transportation. Various routes have been identified for the Hyperloop service, which would operate a super high-speed system to accommodate transport at more than 700 miles per hour.

The Hyperloop system works through the use of pressurized capsules that travel along a frictionless magnetic cushion inside tubes. The capsules are powered by rechargeable batteries, a linear induction motor and electromagnetic propulsion.

The capsules hold 28 to 40 passengers, and the system would allow departures of capsules every 40 seconds. It therefore could move 164,000 passengers per day on each line.

""Regulations are the ultimate barrier for Hyperloop implementation and we are excited to build the first real public private partnership to bring Hyperloop travel to the U.S.,"" said Dick Ahlborn, CEO of HTT.

Economic Opportunity

The market value of transit within the region is estimated at US$15 billion.

HTT has been exploring additional routes within the region that would feed traffic from other major cities into the route, Cooke told TechNewsWorld.

The company is in various stages of discussions with local governments and cities, he added, with plans to announce the additional routes in the future.

HTT last year announced a new innovation center in Tolouse, France, which included plans to develop new offices and a new prototype early this year. It also inked agreements to develop services in India, South Korea and Indonesia.

The company will disclose further project details on Feb. 26 at the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, including additional members of the consortium.

Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, led a bipartisan group of legislators from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois in promoting the Hyperloop Transportation Initiative. The group last month wrote President Donald Trump, asking for the inclusion of $20 million in the fiscal 2019 budget to accelerate the project.

Market Demand

One key question for the long term success of hyperloop technology, is whether it would combine high-speed commuter travel and high-speed freight hauling, noted Steven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research.

""There are folks who envision hyperloop offering something equivalent to a container shipping service to help amortize the project cost and more fully utilize hyperloop capacity,"" he told TechNewsWorld. ""For a new technology like this, customer acceptance is an unknown.""

There are questions as to whether customers would feel claustrophobic in such a train system and be able to tolerate the g forces associated with such high speeds, Polzin added.

Chicago is home to O'Hare International Airport, one of the world's biggest airports, and a major connection hub for connecting flights throughout the midwest.

High-speed rail would only require duplicating what is already available in markets like Europe and Japan, noted Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center.

It would not require the development of new technology, she told TechNewsWorld, and could be built before the Hyperloop study is completed.

Trade Minister Agrees with Proposed 0.5 Percent E-Commerce Tax

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita agrees with the e-commerce tax plan proposed by Industry Minister Airlangga Hartanto.

“Yes I concur,” said Enggartiasto, referring to the 0.5 percent tax rate on Thursday, February 22.

Enggartiasto argues that it would be the best move to support the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and industries (IKM) in the country.

“Remember that the one percent tax previously is from volume, transactions, not from profit loss. Meanwhile, if we talk about 20 percent or 30 percent tax that would be from profit and loss. That would not provide a positive climate,” said Enggartiasto.

However, he said that it is still being devised and that there has been no fixed decision but that it would be around 0.5 percent. This number is based on the fact that e-commerce sales generate roughly around Rp40 million each year, which can be considered to be an income of an IKM.

With the lower tax tariff, Airlangga hopes that there would be more national IKM products joining the already saturated online store considering that products sold on e-commerce platforms are imported products.

He added that smartphone users in Indonesia have currently reached 371 million or 141 percent of the total population. This situation can potentially drive Indonesia to become the third country with the most online business profits after China and the United States.

“The two locations are prepared to become the Silicon Valley of Indonesia,” said the assistant to the Yogyakarta regional secretary for development affairs, Budi Wibowo, in Yogyakarta on Wednesday as reported by Antara news agency.

He said the areas would be converted into an industrial estate that would become the center of fashion, culinary arts, handicrafts, animation and games as well as other creative businesses. “There will be no large manufacturing factories,” he added.

The two areas – 335 hectares in Bantul and 50 hectares in Kulon Progo – have long been the subject of the development plan.

Budi said the provincial and local administration would cooperate with any investors seeking to do business in the two areas, the development of which would be kicked off by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo on March 12.

Furthermore, he said the provincial administration had coordinated with the Bantul and Kulon Progo administrations over the business license issuance plan to ensure a quick and smooth investment process.

He said the tenants of the digital valley would be small and medium enterprises (SMEs) focused on creative businesses. “We have 524,395 SMEs that dominate economic growth in Yogyakarta,” he added. (bbn)"

355;731646632;20180210;2018;http://www.customstoday.com.pk/singapore-mulls-imposing-tax-on-e-commerce/;"SINGAPORE: Singapore may unveil an e-commerce tax in next week’s budget, setting the tone for a region that’s grappling with online retail’s assault on brick-and-mortar vendors. Eight of the 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey said the Feb. 19 budget will contain a new tax on online vendors, with another betting that cross-border digital transactions will now be included in the goods-and-services tax regime. Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia – where governments are funding ambitious infrastructure programs are also considering similar plans.

Southeast Asian governments are seeking to level the playing field for traditional vendors given the rapid growth of online retailing on platforms such as Lazada, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Amazon.com, Inc. BMI Research projects the region’s six biggest economies will boost e-commerce to $64.8 billion in 2021 from $37.7 billion last year, while Credit Suisse Group AG estimates that online shopping growth could outpace that of traditional retailers by six to 10 times over the next few years. An e-commerce tax would ease “the competition for offline retailers that have been struggling amid the rising popularity of online shopping,” Nainika Singh, consumer analyst at BMI Research, said by email. “We are likely to see other Southeast Asian markets follow Singapore’s implementation of this e-commerce tax.”

The road ahead won’t be easy, according to economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye at Maybank Kim Eng Research in Singapore. In Vietnam and the Philippines, online sellers have found ways to evade paying taxes posting goods and services on social media, boosting cash transactions and running multiple sales websites, they wrote in a research note Sunday. While government officials have been tight-lipped about specific plans in the upcoming budget, they’ve cited an urgent need to get organized around the taxation of online merchants. Online shoppers in Singapore are generally able to avoid levies on purchases that don’t exceed S$400 ($300), but given how quickly the industry has transformed, a tax change should’ve been made on this front “ probably yesterday,” Indranee Rajah, senior minister of state for law and finance, said in November. Rajah said in a radio interview last week that the government was still studying the e-commerce tax and it’s certainly something they’d like to implement, according to a Business Times report. Thailand’s Revenue Department expects a proposed e-business levy will triple annual tax revenue growth to 15 percent, according to a Bangkok Post report, quoting Director General Prasong Poontaneat. The draft bill sets the ceiling rate at 15 percent and would apply to online vendors whose domain name is registered in Thailand and who have a payment system in baht or transfer money from within the country. In Indonesia, where e-commerce is booming and the government is struggling to boost revenue, there’s a special urgency for taxes. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told reporters on Jan. 19 that the government would soon be issuing a new rule on e-commerce after consultations with ministries and agencies."

Numerous fintech players have entered the market and several of these have gained notable size and recognition. Here are eight fintech startups in the Philippines to keep an eye on this year:

Venteny

Venteny offers employee benefits and loan services for companies. It allows companies to institute an employee loyalty-point system. Employees are incentivized by discounts to restaurants, hotels, gyms and other activities. In partnership with banks and non-bank financial institutions, Venteny customers can take out short-term loans.

The startup raised two rounds in 2017: the first one, an undisclosed seed funding round, was closed in February and led by Singapore’s KK Fund with participation from Japanese financial group Ocean Capital; and the second one, the startup’s US$2.3 million Series A, was announced in December 2017 and led by SBI Investment with participation from SV-FINTECH Fund, angel investors as well as an unnamed Singaporean firm.

Venteny is looking to expand into other ASEAN markets while focusing on gaining additional values of financial services for company employees in the region.

Acudeen Technologies

Acudeen Technologies is a peer-to-peer marketplace that offers discounted receivables to SMEs to ease cash flow problems.

In June 2017, Acudeen Technologies raised US$6 million to further help businesses grow in the Philippines. The funding came from Rizal Microbank, a Filipino banking corporation. “With this partnership, we’ll be able to reach out to more micro-SME business operators. It is really aligned with our enhanced business model,” said Rizal Microbank president Bong Roxas

“Rather than spending capital, resources on building structures (branches), I would rather use this money to finance the micro-SMEs. This is the sector in the country that can multiply jobs, it has bigger social impact.”

Acudeen Technologies won an international startup competition for emerging markets, bagging US$500,000 in investments from Seedstars in April 2017.

First Circle

First Circle provides a digital platform focused on offering short-term trade credit to SMEs. Its mission is to empower small businesses in emerging ASEAN markets by allowing them to access formal financial services and participate in wider economic activities.

Since the startup’s launch in 2015, First Circle has served hundreds of Metro Manila micro-SMEs from different industries, working in partnership with leading e-commerce platforms such as Lazada and Zalora. First Circle is also a partner of Acudeen Technologies.

First Circle raised US$1.3 million in venture capital from Accion Venture Lab and Deep Blue VC in April 2017. The funding followed a previous investment of US$1.2 million in seed funding from 500 Startups, IMJ Investment Partners, and Key Capital last October 2016.

The startup is currently evaluating potential expansion options as Indonesia or Thailand.

PawnHero

PawnHero is an online pawnshop service in Southeast Asia that aims to solve the problem of expensive credit for consumers in emerging markets. It was first launched in the Philippines in February 2015.

PawnHero allows users to pawn and/or sell their personal belongings in exchange of money. The process is done online and users simply need to schedule a fully insured and free pickup via PawnHero’s trusted logistic partner 2GO, or drop off their items to a 2GO branch. PawnHero sends the money either via bank wire, or through the PawnHero Card – a debit card the company provides customers with for free.

PawnHero signed a partnership with FINTQ, the fintech arm of PLDT, in August 2017. FINTQ runs the Philippines’ online marketplace platform for consumer loans Lendr. The move came shortly after PawnHero raised US$9.7 million through a financing deal with a Philippine investment bank in August 2017.

The PawnHero team is currently running an initial coin offering (ICO) for the Hero Capital Market Platform.

Tagcash

Blockchain startup Tagcash has built a platform that aims to serve as a hub for payments, loyalty programs and social sharing. The platform works with a mobile app that lets users check balances, make transactions and peer-to-peer payments, deposit, withdrawal funds, and more, that supports such cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies.

Founder Mark Vernon said it was inspired by WeChat’s success and wanted to create a similar platform for the Philippines that combines social media features with financial services.

Tagcash is looking to raise up to US$16 million in an ICO by selling a total of 80 million TAG tokens, priced at around US$0.2 per coin. The startup has applied for a virtual currency license and a e-money issuer license from the Banko Sentral ng Pilipnas.

Qwikwire

Qwikwire is a cross-border billing and invoicing platform for enterprises in the Philippines. The platform connects clients to international banking facilities not available in their own countries.

Qwikwire currently specializes in providing solutions for property developers and banks with tools to identify, trace, and manage payments from clients.

The platform is designed to work with the finance and accounting departments of large enterprises by providing administrators the ability to automate report generation for a more efficient management of payments enterprises receive.

Qwikwire won the Ignite PH pitch competition and was awarded a cash prize of US$5,000 in July. The startup is looking to raise US$9 million in an ICO. It has recently launched AQwire, the first blockchain-powered platform for property developers to list their properrties to international buyers.

Salarium

Salarium aims to be the go-to payroll solution for businesses located in Southeast Asia. The company provides an enterprise payroll software at a price point that can be availed by any business. By using a multi-module system, the company seeks to help companies automate payroll from punch-in to payout.

Salarium usually costs US$5 per user or employee. However, every employee paid via SAL Pay does not get charged the US$5 fee. SAL Pay is another service of Salarium which pairs a payment card with an electronic wallet, giving employees a convenient and secure way of getting paid. If a company disburses or pays for at least 90% of all employees via SAL Pay, then Salarium is completely free.

Salarium won the Seedstars global challenge, winning a US$500,000 worth of investments in 2015. The startup is now looking to raise US$20 million in an ICO.

TrueMoney

Founded in 2003, TrueMoney provides e-payment services in Southeast Asia. TrueMoney has a presence in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Indonesia.

The company’s flagship service called TrueMoney Wallet, is an electronic wallet that allows users to scan and pay bills, top up and purchases. TrueMoney also features an online payroll service and a remittance service, and has initiated cross-border remittance from Myanmar and Cambodia, to Thailand.

In the Philippines, TrueMoney has a distribution network comprised of 5,000 TrueMoney Centers, which are currently capable of performing remittance transactions, bills payment, gaming credits, and payments for e-commerce purchases."

358;730654442;20180214;2018;https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/ecommerce_surges_in_indonesia/40040;"JAKARTA: The number of online shoppers in Indonesia grew by almost half last year, as the country continues to embrace digital channels, but new research suggests most are spending relatively little.

Data from FT Confidential Research has indicated that the country gained 11m new online shoppers in 2017, bringing the total to 35m.

Consumers are also shopping online more often, it added: in a survey of 1,000 urban consumers the proportion of those shopping at least once a month had more than doubled to 63.4%, with the greatest uplift coming in among those shopping once a month (from 21.5% in 2016 to 49.8% in 2017).

Most are spending little, however, with six in ten directing around Rp1m ($70) to e-commerce sites over a 12 month-month period. Clothing was the most popular category purchased, followed by mobile phones and accessories, and beauty products.

The same survey showed that product quality and delivery time are the things that most worry people shopping online, with around one third expressing such concerns.

Fraud and scams exercised around one fifth – and FT Confidential Research noted that JD.id, the Indonesian arm of China’s JD.com, had spent Rp215.6bn on TV ads reassuring consumers its products are genuine.

As governments across the region mull a tax on online retail outlets, FT Confidential Research was confident that Indonesia’s proposed 0.5% would not greatly affect the sector.

And it played down the fears of online retailers that the tax would push both buyers and sellers to social media platforms.

“Proper online shops offer better security, product quality control and benefits such as zero per cent interest on loans, free product delivery and, perhaps most importantly, a commerce-friendly user interface,” it said.

359;730390105;20180213;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/16482/indonesia/pajak-pay-taxes/;"Indonesian companies aren’t very diligent when it comes to paying taxes. Instead of filling the state’s accounts, profits go unreported or are stashed in tax havens offshore. In 2016, the government implemented a tax amnesty program, attempting to lure money back into the country, with some success.

There are many reasons why Indonesians dodge taxes – lack of trust in the government is one. Another is the tax filing hassle: it’s a lot of paperwork, and payment can only be made through accredited banks. Granted, that problem isn’t unique to Indonesia. And just like in other countries, people are trying to fix this with software.

OnlinePajak is currently the leading solution in Indonesia, with 500,000 users. Last year, it contributed 4% of the government’s total tax collection, says founder Charles Guinot. It launched in 2015. The basic software is free, but it has a premium component with additional benefits for larger companies.

The startup is interesting from a fintech perspective because of its recently launched feature PajakPay. This allows users to settle their tax bills directly through the software – eliminating the need to settle the bill in a separate process. That’s a first in Indonesia, claims Guinot, and it took “months and months” of discussions with all stakeholders to achieve this.

PajakPay’s integration doesn’t utilise and existing payment gateway or payment service provider Guinot stresses. The tech is developed in-house.

Originally from France, Guinot came to Indonesia six years ago as part of an expansion plan of French trading and manufacturing company Farinia. Guinot struggled with the company’s tax reporting in Indonesia, and because he has an IT background, he set about solving it. That was the start of OnlinePajak, which he now runs while still involved in the other business.

Since its inception, OnlinePajak has worked closely with Indonesia’s tax department. The tax department has a framework that allows third party developers to link up with its system. However it took Guinot two years to get the license and software to the point where he could launch. “It takes time to build trust, to deliver the tech, to comply with the all regulations. I was spending most of my time at the tax office,” Guinot recalls.

PajakOnline’s deep integration with the tax office’s systems down to the payment part makes it an attractive partner to other software providers who target corporates and small businesses. PajakOnline’s module can be built into human resources management software, for example, and it already works with some, like Talenta.

Other possible partners could be bill payments apps. Companies like Go-Jek, which has its roots in ride-hailing, and e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia already let users settle bills like electricity and health insurance through their apps. With PajakPay, this could be extended to tax payments sometime down the line.

OnlinePajak recently raised a round of investment from VC firms including Sequoia Capital, which also invests in Go-Jek and Tokopedia, and Indonesian VC Alpha JWC.

Conversion with Go-Jek and other apps will happen “for sure,” says Guinot. In November last year, Go-Jek’s CEO Nadiem Makarim told local media his firm has applied for a license which would let his firm act as a tax agent. He said Go-Jek’s database comprises 100.000 merchants ready file their taxes. However, he did not disclose whether Go-Jek plans to develop the capability itself of wants to partner with third party providers like OnlinePajak.

The Kuala Lumpur-headquartered venture is founded by Chua and Singaporean Darren Chua, previously with IE Singapore, and it is targeting a $40 million total close. Chua declined to say how far advanced the project is, but we did a little digging and industry sources suggest it has closed around $10 million thus far.

The fund is focused on startups in a range of industry verticals including travel, property, FMCG, logistics, property and “female-focused economics,” Chua told TechCrunch in an interview. On that last vertical, Chua cites Gobi’s successful exit from Malaysia-based skincare and cosmetics startup Hermo — the firm received $13 million for its 60 percent stake courtesy of a deal with public Japanese firm Istyle.

Chua said the deal represented a massive return on investment despite the fact that Hermo had never expanded beyond Malaysia. He believes that the opportunity for female-focused business will only increase in the region.

Geographically, the fund’s focus is on Southeast Asia, and in particular Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. Myanmar and the Philippines are on the radar.

In particular, Chua said he will tap his network in Thailand and Vietnam — developed from his time at Gobi — while Chua has extensive experience working in Myanmar among other markets. Two other partners are in the process of joining the firm but cannot be named at this point, he added.

Vynn Capital plans to begin investments by the end of February with a primary target of seed and pre-Series A deals. Chua said it would reserve significant funds for follow-on deals that would take it into Series A investments and potentially belong. All told, the firm is looking at making around 15-20 deals with its inaugural fund.

Chua declined to give specific LP information, but he said the firm is backed by “traditional families keen get into the new era of business where technology plays a huge role.”

Three publicly-announced advisors to the fund include Malaysia-based advertising industry pioneer Tan Sri Vincent Lee, Indonesian business leader SD Darmono, Dr Mario Hardy, the Thailand-based CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA).

Chua, who spent three years with Gobi, is not the only Southeast Asia-based VC to switch out of a larger fund to establish his own.

Yinglan Tan, formerly with Sequoia, launched his $20 million Insignia Venture Partners firm last year. Other prominent firms covering the seed to Series A and beyond include Golden Gate Ventures, Monks Hill Ventures, Venturra Capital, NSI Ventures, and Jungle Ventures’ SeedPlus unit. Of course, there is also Gobi itself, which is heavily anchored in China but has a local presence in Southeast Asia.

Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia -- where governments are funding ambitious infrastructure programs -- are also considering similar plans.Southeast Asian governments are seeking to level the playing field for traditional vendors given the rapid growth of online retailing on platforms such as Lazada, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Amazon.com Inc. BMI Research projects the region’s six biggest economies will boost e-commerce to $64.8 billion in 2021 from $37.7 billion last year, while Credit Suisse Group AG estimates that online shopping growth could outpace that of traditional retailers by six to 10 times over the next few years.An e-commerce tax would ease “the competition for offline retailers that have been struggling amid the rising popularity of online shopping,” Nainika Singh, consumer analyst at BMI Research, said by email. “We are likely to see other Southeast Asian markets follow Singapore’s implementation of this e-commerce tax.”The road ahead won’t be easy, according to economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye at Maybank Kim Eng Research in Singapore. In Vietnam and the Philippines, online sellers have found ways to evade paying taxes -- posting goods and services on social media, boosting cash transactions and running multiple sales websites, they wrote in a research note Sunday.SingaporeWhile government officials have been tight-lipped about specific plans in the upcoming budget, they’ve cited an urgent need to get organized around the taxation of online merchants.Online shoppers in Singapore are generally able to avoid levies on purchases that don’t exceed S$400 ($300), but given how quickly the industry has transformed, a tax change should’ve been made on this front “probably yesterday,” Indranee Rajah, senior minister of state for law and finance, said in November.Rajah said in a radio interview last week that the government was still studying the e-commerce tax and it’s certainly something they’d like to implement, according to a Business Times report.ThailandThailand’s Revenue Department expects a proposed e-business levy will triple annual tax revenue growth to 15 percent, according to a Bangkok Post report, quoting Director General Prasong Poontaneat.The draft bill sets the ceiling rate at 15 percent and would apply to online vendors whose domain name is registered in Thailand and who have a payment system in baht or transfer money from within the country.IndonesiaIn Indonesia, where e-commerce is booming and the government is struggling to boost revenue, there’s a special urgency for taxes.Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told reporters on Jan. 19 that the government would soon be issuing a new rule on e-commerce after consultations with ministries and agencies.“The basic principle is that we will create a level playing field, the tax approach for e-commerce and conventional players will be the same,” especially for value-added taxation, she said.In order to protect small- and medium-sized enterprises that supply much of the newly taxed vendors, the government is proposing a lower income tax for those merchants, Indrawati said.MalaysiaThe Customs Department in Malaysia has been talking about plans around taxing foreign e-commerce players for months. While nothing is in hand yet, BMI Research’s Singh sees Malaysia following Singapore’s lead with a 6 percent levy on these online providers - Bloomberg

“Many respondents believe policies pursued at a city level have greater influence on businesses’ digital success than those originating at the national level. This view is especially strong in Asian metropolises such as Shanghai, Beijing, Bangalore and Jakarta, but also in Barcelona and New York,” the report said.

The Indonesian Fintech Association’s director of public policy, Ajisatria Suleiman, said Jakarta is indeed not San Francisco’s Silicon Valley, where many world-class tech companies and skilled professionals reside.

Its strength, he said, came from startup communities and coworking spaces, in which digital entrepreneurs could meet and share their ideas.

“Tech and digital development in Jakarta is very fast at the moment. It is dubbed the next China from Southeast Asia. Venture capitals directly contact these communities,” Ajisatria told The Jakarta Post on Friday.

He said about 80 to 90 percent of 235 fintech companies currently resided in the capital.

Rieka Handayani, the head of public relations for the Indonesian E-Commerce Association (idEA), said the Jakarta administration had eased the business licensing process for startups.

“The process to obtain permits is not as complicated as in the past, when the administration asked for so many documents. Now, as long as we have a business plan and a revenue model, we can get permits,” Rieka said.

Some members of idEA said the licensing process in Jakarta and other big cities, such as Bandung and Yogyakarta, was getting easier because of the government’s support for digital businesses, she said.

There are many city-owned and private coworking spaces, as well as virtual offices that digital professionals can use.

The city administration itself currently manages two coworking spaces — JSC Hive, in Kuningan, South Jakarta, and Jakarta Creative Hub in Kebon Melati, Tanah Abang.

According to a recent study, one in three Southeast Asian consumers planning to buy a car is open to purchasing an EV.

The finding demonstrates the region’s strong potential to speed up the electrification of mobility.

The result of the Nissan-commissioned study by Frost & Sullivan, entitled ‘The Future of Electric Vehicles in Southeast Asia’, was announced by Yutaka Sanada, Regional Senior Vice President of Nissan at the ‘Nissan Futures’ in Singapore last Tuesday.

Nissan Futures is a gathering of industry leaders, government officials and invited media, which included the Bulletin.

The study revealed that 37 per cent of prospective buyers in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines are open to considering an electric vehicle as their next car if tax is waived.

The same number of people also expects that their residence should have a charging station for EV.

Customers in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia emerged as the most enthusiastic about EVs.

With the right incentives, the region can accelerate the adoption of electric and electrified vehicles, the study showed.

Yutaka Sanada explained, ""We are at a crossroad. There are many reasons to be optimistic about this region, especially in Southeast Asia where its GDP is at US$2.7 trillion and its population stands at 445 million – meaning that the average income is near to that of China’s.""

At the same time, he added, ""There are numerous challenges, namely pollution, traffic jams, and climate change. These are some of the trends – the consequences of fast growing economies. To address these challenges, we need to be innovative and have intelligent solutions to create a better future.

""The aim of the Nissan Futures is to address the future of mobility. When we talk about the future, car manufacturers, the media, governments and stakeholders can play their specific roles,"" Yutaka Sanada said.

He added, ""We are pursuing the ‘Nissan intelligent mobility’ to move the people to a better world. Nissan believes in promoting electric vehicles not only as a mean of transportation but as a new type of vehicle where owners help their cities and communities to manage energy effectively.""

""Nissan wants to take the leadership role in bringing new mobility technology in electrification and autonomous driving,"" Yutaka Sanada said.

He pointed out that Nissan has been in the front for bringing EVs to the mass market; the company introduced its first edition of Nissan Leaf in 2010 and sold more than 300,000 worldwide – it is currently the best-selling EV cars.

""Nissan Leaf is the most advanced EV in the world with the widest reach as well as the greatest stability,"" Yutaka Sanada said.

He said positive customers’ response on the second edition of the Nissan Leaf launched four months ago is very strong in Japan, Europe and the US.

The Regional Senior Vice President said the new Nissan Leaf is 100 per cent electric, featuring a suite of advanced technologies showcasing Nissan ingenuity, and will go on sale in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand during the coming fiscal year.

This will be followed by Philippines and Indonesia, he said, adding that the company needs cooperation from the public and a private sector as well as stakeholders to successfully promote the EV technology."

Government Targets 20 Startups from Small Industries in 2018

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Ministry of Industry targeted 20 startups generated from small and medium industries (IKM) in 2018. In 2017, the target was nine industries.

“In 2014 we have five, eight in 2015, and eleven in 2016,” Industry Ministry's IKM Director-General Gati Wibawaningsih said in a press release received by Tempo Wednesday, February 7.

Gati said that her office has set a strategic program to educate the national IKM entrepreneurs so they can market their products through a marketplace. The Ministry has created a digital platform called e-Smart IKM to support it, she added.

In the IKM guidance program, the Ministry will cooperate with PT Ruang Raya Indonesia (ruangguru.com) to increase the human resources (SDM) capacity in the industrial sector.

The startup company is needed to sell the products of local IKM. To face the digital economy era, IKM entrepreneurs should utilize the latest manufacturing technology and also the e-commerce opportunity.

The IKM growth has increased significantly. In 2015 the number of IKM was at 3,68 million business units that rose to 4,41 million in 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, it reached 4,59 million.

367;728807379;20180207;2018;http://fintechnews.sg/16303/blockchain/ico-regulation-asia-overview/;"The cryptocurrency and initial coin offering (ICO) craze has put pressure on regulators around the world as the number of scams and cases of fraud keeps on growing in the space.

Countries in Asia have had varied stands on cryptocurrencies with nations like China and South Korea emerging amongst the most rigid jurisdictions, while countries such as Singapore and Japan have opted for a more laissez-faire approach.

China has been taking ever-increasing steps to curb cryptocurrencies trading and has been amongst the most stringent regulators regarding cryptocurrencies.

This started off by banning ICOs in September 2017, followed by ordering a bank account freeze associated with exchange platforms, kicking out bitcoin miners in January 2018, and most recently, instituting a nationwide ban on Internet and mobile access to cryptocurrency trading, blocking domestic and foreign services to “prevent financial risk.”

South Korea too banned ICOs as well as margin trading of cryptocurrencies in September 2017. Regulators cited the unprecedented number of fraud in the ICO sector.

Contrary to mainland China, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has confided itself to publishing a set of rules for companies looking to launch an ICO.

Japan, on the other hand, has been considered as one of the most permissive jurisdictions regarding cryptocurrencies. In April 2017, new legislation authorizing cryptocurrency as a legal payment method came into force.

Today, Japan is the second largest market for bitcoin trading, accounting for 37% of the world’s bitcoin trading volume, according to data from Cryptocompare.

But the recent hack of Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has prompted backlash from the community and closer oversight from the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

The FSA has previously released risk warnings for ICO-related investments, noting that “the price of a token may decline or become worthless suddenly” and warning that the high “potential for fraud” in the space.

The FSA has also emphasized that some ICOs “may fall within the scope of the Payment Services Act and/or the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act depending on how they are structured.”

Nearby, in Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission chairman Wellington Koo said in October 2017 that the government intended to support the development and adoption of ICOs and acknowledge blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as lawful.

Koo stated that the Taiwan government was not planning to ban crypto-related activities and further promised a government comprehensive support.

In Southeast Asia, regulators have taken various approaches. Indonesia, the region’s largest economy, issued a regulation in December 2017 banning use of cryptocurrency by fintech companies involved in payment systems. Bank of Indonesia said it is examining whether there’s a need to regulate trading on digital currency exchanges.

A statement by the central bank issued in January 2018 advised citizens to not sell, buy or trade cryptocurrency because of “bubble risks” and susceptibility to be used for “money laundering and terrorist financing.”

Indonesian cryptocurrency exchanges BitBayar and TokoBitcoin closed following the announcement.

Meanwhile, Singapore has emerged as a hub for ICOs, thanks to its convenient taxation rules and supportive government stand towards fintech. The city-state’s central bank and financial regulator the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued a set of guidelines for token sales in November 2017, noting that the regulator “does not regulate virtual currencies; in fact, we welcome them as an innovation that can potentially reduce the cost of financial transactions. But we regulate the activities that surround virtual currencies if these activities pose specific risks.”

In Malaysia, the Securities Commission issued a press release in September 2017, warning investors “to be mindful of the potential risks involved in ICO schemes.”

“As the terms and features of ICO schemes may differ in each case, investors who wish to engage or invest in ICO schemes are reminded to seek legal or other professional advice if there are doubts on the legitimacy of these schemes,” the statement concluded.

In Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission shared its views on ICOs in September 2017, citing concerns that “in some cases, ICO may be deliberately used as a tool for fraud and scam.”

Most recently, the Philippines has confirmed upcoming cryptocurrency and ICO regulations to reduce fraud risks and protect investors.

In quotes reported by Reuters, Emilio Aquino, the commissioner in charge of enforcement and investor protection for the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission, said:

“We need to act because ICOs are sprouting especially in 2017. We want to come up with our own set of regulations. You have to be extra careful how investors in this new space are protected.”

The closure of at least two imported footwear outlets in Indonesia was evidence of an obvious decline in the imported shoe market, Aprisindo head Eddy Widjanarko said on Friday, according to a kontan.co.id report.

Clarks, an international shoe manufacturer and retailer based in the UK that is set to close all of their outlets in Indonesia at the end of this month, launched a 50 percent to 80 percent ""everything must go"" sale on Jan. 31 at all its stores. Meanwhile, PT Mahkota Petriedo Indoperkasa, the official distributor of France-based global fashion brand Kickers, will also close their footwear outlet at Kota Kasablanka Mall in South Jakarta.

Eddy said three significant factors negatively affected imported shoe sales in Indonesia: the high cost of renting outlet space, high import duties and the fast growth of e-commerce.

“People today, especially the youth, can easily purchase imported shoes online by themselves. This is actually another threat to retailers,” said Eddy.

Eddy said shoe manufacturers that opened outlets in Indonesia had bigger challenges in making a profit, as they spent more operational costs in paying import duties as well as rent for outlet spaces. These factors also raised the prices of imported shoes sold in physical outlets, making them more expensive than the same products sold online.

Clarks opened its first Indonesian outlet in 2004 under its local distributor, PT Anglo Distrindo Antara. Clarks has 25 stores across the country. (roi/bbn)"

Trade Minister to Gather Marketplaces for SME Products

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita will gather marketplaces to help the Micro Small Medium Enterprises (SME) in marketing their products. The minister previously heard that Blibli.com had only managed to sell 100,000-200,000 of 2.5 million marketed SME products.

Minister Enggar continued that he would ask the provincial office to select all of the SME products that will be marketed through the marketplace.

“The presence of this large marketplace does not make Indonesia as a market for domestic products but instead market the Indonesian products abroad,” Enggar said.

Enggar will also ask for a free of charge to get a Certificate of Origin (SKA) for the buyer. SKA is a document made by an exporter (seller) when they export goods to a particular country.

Previously, to get the certificate, the buyer must pay a printing fee but the trade minister wanted to simplify the process by shifting it to the electronic system.

A college kid, obviously a newbie, even claimed profits 45 times the initial investment.

David Kurniawan, who works at a mobile intelligence company, is a case in point.

The 27-year-old said he had made US$1,060 in profit on his $2,733 investment in Ethereum, a cryptocurrency originating from Russia, in the space of only seven months.

Compare that to 5 percent you would earn on a time deposit in a year, or the average of 10 percent profit on stocks, then you get the picture.

Ethereal was quoted at $393 a coin when David started, and now it is $944.

“Buy low, and sell high,” he said, adding that it was not all that different from investing in gold, real currencies and stocks.

Good advice for anyone contemplating to play in the cryptocurrency market: Watch the market closely. No one can rule out a bubble.

The volatility of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has shown that trading is not exactly for the faint of heart and the reason why Indonesia, among other countries that include China and South Korea, have moved to ban cryptocurrency.

Starting at $9.37 at its launch in 2009, it jumped to $60.89 in March 2013 and to $936 in January 2017.

It reached its peak at $19,203 on Dec. 17 but has since been dropping. On Friday, it was still worth $11,470.

Bitcoin is one of 48 cryptocurrencies now being traded globally. Besides Ethereum quoted at $1,159 on Friday, other popular coins include Litecoin ($182.08), Zcash ($463.8) and Dash ($ 801.65).

The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance said there were around three million active cryptocurrency users worldwide in May 2017.

But PT Bitcoin Indonesia said in December that 900,000 Indonesian users have traded in its currency in the last two years. It also claimed to have a 70 percent share in the Indonesian cryptocurrency market.

Aladincoin, a cryptocurrency issued by the United States-based financial institute Aladin Capital, held a conference last week to announce its entry into the Indonesian market, with claims of having the support of the World Bank.

The government had initially warned people about huge potential losses in cryptocurrency trading, but in December the central bank moved to ban it outright.

Any payment using cryptocurrency would be considered illegal because it violated Law No. 7/2011 on currency that states that the rupiah was the only legal currency for transactions in Indonesia.

Administrative sanctions would be leveled at financial services that facilitate these transactions.

“There are no regulators or administrators supervising bitcoin,” Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo recently said. “Its value is not based on any underlying economic fundamentals.”"

""The government plans to collect taxes for e-commerce, but the policy will affect the development of these businesses, particularly the marketplaces. Therefore, we want a public trial first,” said idEA chairman Aulia Ersyah Marinto on Tuesday.

He said that last week, the ministry had invited idEA to discuss the draft of a new tax regulation to collect 0.5 percent value added tax (VAT) from each seller.

According to the Director General of Taxation Regulation No. SE-62/PJ/2013, the VAT is to be collected from four kinds of e-commerce: online marketplaces, classified ads, daily deals and online retail.

For classified ads, the tax is to be collected from the rental fees sellers pay to rent online slots to offer their goods, while for online retail, where the owner of the website is also the seller, the VAT is to be collected from their transactions.

Meanwhile, for online marketplaces and daily deals, the VAT is to be collected from the business that rents online slots to sellers and from the transactions between registered buyers and sellers.

""Since they are not applying these rules to people who sell through social media, we feel that it is unfair,"" she said.

Sari also said that the policy will create huge technical problems especially in terms of operational and investment costs. Sari is asking the government to be wise before putting the rule into effect.

""Let's not talk about technology—but about the human resources first. We would need plenty of that,"" she said.

Many media outlets chose to present the news with headlines proclaiming that cryptocurrencies are illegal in Indonesia, even though the regulation itself only states that they can’t be used as a form of payment, just like other countries’ currencies can’t be used to buy things in Indonesia.

BI’s announcement coincided with news of raids on some coffee shops in Bali who had started accepting Bitcoin as payment method.

And around the same time, other countries also declared their intention to tighten regulations around cryptocurrencies. South Korea said it was considering a ban on the trade of cryptocurrencies, though it later revised this apply only to anonymous trading.

The avalanche of bad news led to concern in the Indonesian crypto community, who believed that crypto ownership or trading might altogether be criminalized in the country, says Danny Taniwan who runs Indonesia Blockchain Network, and online community that shares information and organises meetups.

He has a relaxed outlook. “I was there at BI’s press conference, it was much more nuanced than what the media later reported,” he says. BI expressed no intention to shut down cryptocurrency exchanges which means crypto ownership and trading are not affected.

Though the regulatory environment in Indonesia is known to be volatile, Taniwan thinks that no major changes have to be expected right now. “Regulators understand that they need this innovation. The intention of press conference was to remind the public of the risks of investing in and trading cryptocurrencies.”

Multiple government work groups are currently exploring how to work with blockchain to improve transparency processes like land rights certificates and citizen identification.

Ola senior vice president Yugantar Saikia said the cab aggregator is planning to visit seven-eight campuses and hire students who will play an integral role in helping the company expand its operations with innovative mobility solutions.B-school grads will join Ola’s operations, product management and human resource teams, and some may even work on a rotational assignment basis, said Saikia.While top IIMs will host final placements next month, at Bschools that have already completed the process, the increase in ecommerce and startup hiring is evident. These schools had seen hiring by the segment reach a high in 2015, then decline as the sector went through a rough patch.Things are looking up again. At Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), Delhi, for instance, there has been a 63% rise in ecommerce offers coupled with a 19% jump in the average salary package, said Sanjay Verma, placement advisor.Students of Mumbai-based SPJIMR have got 27 offers from ecommerce companies: 10 from Flipkart; seven from Amazon and four from Paytm. Salaries offered ranged from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 39.5 lakh per year. MDI Gurgaon placements chairperson Kanwal Kapil said 10 companies from the sector absorbed 23 students this time. Major recruiters included Oyo (six), Lenskart (two), Moglix (two) and UpGrad (three).Online education platform UpGrad is recruiting from Bschools for the first time this year. It plans to hire 15-20 students from the IIMs at Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow and MDI, said cofounder Mayank Kumar.Another startup making its debut at management schools is Go-Jek, Indonesia’s first unicorn.“We are hiring graduates with at least two-three years of work experience. We are looking at talent from the ISBs (Indian Schools of Business) and IIMs, as well as Great Lakes,” said Sidu Ponnappa, director, Go-Jek.While UpGrad is paying salaries of Rs 15-18 lakh, Go-Jek is paying around Rs 25 lakh.“Innovative perks and ESOPs (employee stock options) are on the rise. One company in our portfolio is also considering a cryptocurrency-based reward system,” said Rohit Chokhani, principal founder of Mumbai-based early-stage venture capital firm White Unicorn Ventures, which has about 20 companies in its portfolio.“Strong entrepreneurial skills will be preferred. Among the softer skills we are looking at are good time management, leadership abilities and conflict resolution.”Apart from IIMs and other leading B-schools, the portfolio companies are also looking at local B-school hires in their territories because of candidates having a better understanding of local markets.“One major trend we foresee at B-school placements this year is many more internet product companies like us opening verticals for programme management teams,” said Sriram Vaidhyanathan, chief human resource officer of BankBazaar. “This is an area in which companies will be investing heavily in terms of talent, so it looks to be a good year for management graduates.”The online lending marketplace plans to recruit at least 15 graduates as business and product analysts compared with last year’s 10.The demand for more management talent is also spurring some companies to add more campuses to their list. Online fashion retailers Myntra and Jabong are looking to recruit at least 5-8% of their organisational size off B-schools and have added institutes such as XLRI and IIM Lucknow to their list of campuses to recruit from, said Amit Mathur, head of talent acquisition, Myntra and Jabong.Since they are among Day 1 companies at most B-schools, salaries are competitive, Mathur said. At ISB, for instance, the lowest offered by Flipkartowned Myntra-Jabong was Rs 18 lakh; the highest was ?25 lakh. “We are looking at those with a high level of ownership who can demonstrate a good culture fit. We want candidates who can learn quickly, strategise and execute work in various functions,” said Mathur."

The hotel start-up is eyeing new development opportunities for its pop-up shipping container guestrooms.

The new shipping container suites will follow their first location in Nordhavn, Copenhagen, which recently opened in October last year. The group is currently in talks to sign franchise agreements across the globe, particularly in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. The eco-friendly brand's first stop will be in Thailand with a 50-unit complex, which is currently being developed.

The group has said that it purchased an inventory of shipping containers not only to capitalize on the growing traveler trends in affordability, sustainability and unique experiences, but also to make a positive impact on the environment through the tourism industry. ""We often see ourselves as part of a greater movement,” Kristoffer Blom, co-founder of Poshtel PopUp, told TTG Asia. ""Sustainability is one of the main factors. Sustainability has moved from being a niche to a necessity. Not (simply) stickers about towels on the floor; we mean deeply embedded responsible behavior in every piece and element of the business. You can pretty much view the suites as banks of raw materials.”

Poshtel converts these containers into budget- and eco-friendly luxury guestrooms and suites and will transport them anywhere around the world.

380;724650379;20180116;2018;http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2130141/indonesian-fintech-start-mekar-eyes-potential-venture-capital-funding;"Mekar, the Indonesian fintech start-up controlled by tycoon Putera Sampoerna, will seek financing from foreign venture capital investors as it looks to deepen its use of technology to expand its microcredit lending service both within and outside the country.

Thierry Sanders, chief executive officer of Mekar, told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of last week’s Family Office Solutions Showcases in Hong Kong that since the start-up’s inception in January 2016, it has successfully intermediated micro loans totalling US$7 million, typically at US$250 per loan.

Through its P2P website, these micro loans are extended to small farmers and shop-owners across the 17,000 islands making up the archipelago, which is also the world’s fourth most populous nation at over 260 million.

Mekar, which means “blossom” in Indonesian, has its origins tied to the tycoon’s wish for more accessible credit in the country. As the heir to the biggest tobacco business HM Sampoerna Tbk, known for its clove cigarettes until it was sold to Philip Morris in 2005, Sampoerna had in 2010 discussed with Sanders about his desire to help the many small businesses in Indonesia access credit with the help of technology.

In Indonesia, banks find it challenging to reach small businesses in such a vast country, while credit co-operatives lack funding to be able to lend to them.

Our goal is to lend to small businesses with up to 50 employees that find it hard to get credit and would otherwise have to seek out to loan sharks

Thierry Sanders, CEO of Mekar

Technology should tackle these challenges, and this subsequently gave birth to Mekar, which operates under the Putera Sampoerna Foundation, a social enterprise affiliated to Indonesian conglomerate Sampoerna Strategic and led by the 70-year-old tycoon’s son Michael.

“Our goal is to lend to small businesses with up to 50 employees that find it hard to get credit and would otherwise have to seek out to loan sharks,” Sanders said.

With over 90 per cent of the 1.1 million small borrowers on Mekar being women – which is a typical microfinance lending model popular also in India and Bangladesh because of women’s supposedly better repayment behaviour than men – Mekar promises investors annual percentage rate of up to 16 per cent for a one-year lock-up term, while charging borrowers 24 per cent.

The investors of these loans are Indonesian banks, such as Bank Woori Saudara and Bank Sampoerna. These banks deposit their funding through Mekar, after choosing from all the business descriptions published by the credit co-operatives on Mekar’s website.

Sanders said over the next two months, the platform will also be opened to foreign investors to invest in microloans on its platform.

The next step will be to invite foreign investors – which could be a venture capital sponsor – to own 25-30 per cent of the business by the end of this year, at which point he expects Mekar to reach break-even.

“We are looking for investors that have a good reputation, which are known for bringing governance structure to their portfolio companies,” Sanders said.

Mekar uses machine learning technology to help approve loans for business-owners, checking if the loan applicant’s facial features matches with the photo on their identity cards. Sanders said going forward, Mekar’s operating model also has potential to be exported to countries such as the Philippines, also an archipelago with over 7,000 islands."

Finance Minister of Indonesia, Sri Mulyani said on Friday, January 19, 2018, ""We have finished the discussion between the ministries / agencies, now the last formulation must wait from the PMK side. For PPh, majority of suppliers are MSMEs. Now, we are proposing that the taxes be revised to reduce the tariff to half, "" he said.

Previously, the government has also asserted that tax imposition on electronic transactions will be more related to the procedure, not to the imposition of a new type of tax.



Tax collection is applied to e-commerce actors who own the application, and not a new tax object because it's only changed the way of transaction, from conventional to electronics.

REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA -- The government has finalized a regulation on electronic or e-commerce, including taxation for such operators. The government also vowed to impose tax fairly on e-commerce to avoid a gap between conventional and digital trade operators.

""We have finalized inter-institution discussions, and now, we are formulating a ministerial regulation,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani noted here on Friday after a press conference on the foiling of an attempt to smuggle 40 kilograms of methamphetamine in Aceh.

According to Mulyani, some parties had suggested that the government should adopt an unbiased approach. ""Some inputs, basically proposed follow the principle of evenhandedness, which means both will have a level playing field. The tax imposed on both e-commerce and conventional commerce will be the same, especially those linked to value-added tax,"" Mulyani explained.

On the final income tax on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the government has planned to reduce its tariff from one percent to 0.5 percent in a bid to boost their competitiveness to better compete with imported products in the digital era.

The tax will be imposed on personal taxpayers and SMEs, with an annual turnover of less than Rp4.8 billion. ""Most of the suppliers for merchants are SMEs. We are proposing a revision to reduce the final income tax from one percent to 0.5 percent. Maybe the threshold could be lower too,"" the minister added.

Earlier, the government had asserted that tax imposition on e-commerce will focus on its mechanism instead of imposing a new type of tax.

The tax will be imposed for e-commerce operators that have the application, and it will not be set as a new object since the government had only changed the transaction method, from conventional to electronic.

The government is still evaluating the method for the imposition of tax, as taxpayers in the e-commerce sector have various characteristics.

""With regard to the mechanism, it will use the current general provision on taxation on who will collect and report, and how the process will be carried out. We will see and disseminate information on this,"" Mulyani added."

""We are looking at a 4X growth towards the end of this calendar year on a monthly basis. We will expand our supply and are targeting about 12,000 cabs by December,"" Greg Moran, founder of Zoomcar told Moneycontrol in an interaction.

According to multiple media reports, Zoomcar has been in talks with multiple investors, including automobile firm Mahindra & Mahindra besides existing investor Ford Smart Mobility to raise USD 50 million.

Moran, however, denied that the company was in talks to raise funds. He added that Zoomcar was making money on a city basis and did not need another round of fundraising for an immediate expansion. The company has its business across 30 cities in India.

The company has so far raised USD 45 million from Ford, Sequoia Capital, Empire Angels, Nokia Growth Partners, among others.

A fully owned subsidiary of US-based Zoomcar Inc, Moran launched the company in 2014 along with David Back - his friend from the University of Pennsylvania. The company offers users cars for self-driving on rent. It doesn't own the inventory but aggregates cabs.

However, according to Moran, who hails from the US, doing business in India has not been an easy task.

""The regulatory environment is very challenging for our business. The process of registration of cars is really painstaking and tedious... that's what we are focused on streamlining. So most of our energy and investment time and money goes into rectifying those processes,"" he said.

The company that currently has around 3,000 cars claims that India as a market has an appetite for at least one lakh cars for self-driving purpose.

""You look at countries such as the US and China .. all these countries have lakhs and lakhs of self-drive cabs. Even if you cut that number by 90 percent you still have the potential for a lot of cars in India. In fact, India is inherently a better market for self-drive cars because it is something where you share the car as supposed to own it,"" he said.

""You have affordability issues in India. Automotives are one of the most expensive goods than anywhere else in the world. Finance wise, India has exorbitantly high interest. You have an extremely inhospitable environment for ownership in India,"" he added.

While he declined to share the number of rides Zoomcar was doing on a daily basis, he said that the average ticket size would range between Rs 5,000-7,000 for approximately a day and a half.

In India, intra-city ride market is dominated by heavily funded cab aggregators Ola and Uber that transports customers from one point to another. And a self-drive car rental service is mostly limited to leisure rides within or outside the city.

Moran denies that Zoomcar gets a direct competition from Ola and Uber adding that Zoomcar is much affordable than cab aggregates.

""We are significantly cheaper than Ola and Uber. We obviously don't have a driver. It is not anyway comparative at all. Our service is more convenient. And people who value privacy than having a driver, prefer us,"" he said.

The self-drive car rental segment also has about 20 odd startups including JustRide and Revv, among others. However, Zoomcar claims to be having over 70 percent market share.

Last month, Zoomcar also launched PEDL, a technology-enabled cycle sharing service. It expects the segment to contribute a significant percentage of its revenue in 2018.

""Over time the revenue coming from this segment will certainly become significant. The cars will still be a majority of the revenue because generally, the average ticket size is much larger, still cycle would form a very significant portion... double digit by the end of this financial year,"" he said.

Zoomcar also has international expansion plans and plans to cover South East Asia, to begin with.

""We will be in Indonesia, the Philippines all these countries in South East Asia, over the next year .. those markets are very strong they don't have any player,"" he said, declining to share the investment details"

In fact, 89% of those interviewed by CSG International, a Colorado-based business support solutions provider, suggested that they would prefer an ""Uber-like"" tool that provides technician location and continually updated estimated arrival times.This preference is also reflected in the Customers 2020 report by Walker, a customer experience consulting firm. The report suggested that the customer experience has overtaken price and product as the key brand differentiator.Customer care, therefore, is that last link of an enterprises' chain which has the power to rattle the entire chain. And it is this last link that a year old startup wants to untangle for enterprises. Zuper is an enterprise mobility platform which enables organisations to manage, modernise and transform field and remote workforce.""Customers no longer want to wait for a 4-8 hour window for the service technician to arrive; they are expecting up-to-the minute information about events, wants to be notified when the technician is on the way, what time the technician will arrive and how long it will take to complete the job. But, when it comes to field service, organizations are struggling to meet the growing demands of the customers resulting in huge loss of revenue and customer churn. Organisations are encountering multiple challenges dealing with field workforce,"" says cofounder of Zuper, Anand Balaji.Industry experts, shares Balaji, put this market at a massive $30 billion. ""There are 1.8 billion field and mobile workers across the world and more than 85% does not leverage technology. There is no clear leader in the industry,"" adds Balaji.Zuper entered the field in August 2016 and already has a list of impressive clients - IKEA-India Carriers , and more. Organisations using Zuper, claims Balaji, have increased workforce utilisation by over 50%, reduced service turnaround time by over 35%, increased customer adoption and profitability by over 45%, operating more efficiently and reduced costs by over 30%.Zuper is a mobile-first, cloud-first B2B SaaS offering which can be used by organisations of any shape and size. The platform offers many plug and play modules to organisations to enable them to manage their workforces. Some of the most popular modules are: remote timesheet management with facial and voice biometrics. ""We are the first platform in Asia to offer voice biometrics based remote timesheet management of field and remote workforce.Organisations can leverage fit for purpose applications and experiences to connect the entire workforce whether the employee is on the field, dispatcher or in the back office. Other than the timesheet scenarios, the biometrics capabilities are deeply embedded with the rest of the workflow, allowing organizations to perform real-time identity verification to ensure the right employee is at the right customer location,"" explains Balaji.Zuper offers work order management, smart scheduling & dispatching, real-time location tracking, inventory management, knowledge management, real-time identity management, remote timesheet management, customer management, alerts & notifications, and more of such capabilities.The company also provides offline mode support for critical operations to counter patchy network in India allowing users to perform their tasks. The platform also offers integrations with major CRM, ERPs, Payment Solutions, IoT devices, Smart Home Appliances, Cloud Telephony, etc. ""The platform can essentially integrate with any applications, devices and tools to ensure the companies have a full 360-degree view of their field originations and can operate at the highest level of efficiency and productivity,"" says Balaji.Zuper also comes with a predictive analytics engine that helps organizations forecast their work-orders, and schedule smartly. The company has also received a provisional patent and IP protection for their ML based smart scheduling and intelligent & automated diagnostic system.""Our goal is to enable organizations to ""Zuperise"" field workforce and dispatch the right field person to the right place at the right time with the right knowledge and tools. Transform customer experience and business with connected field service,"" summarises Balaji.The startup was recently awarded the ""MG Drives Innovation Award"" by MG Motor and is now in talks to develop a solution which will help the British auto company to improve their after sales offerings.Offering these solutions the startup has built a good traction and has onboarded over 40 customers across India and some from Singapore, making the number of end users over 6000.However, Balaji says the company is just starting up, given the growing size of the opportunity. ""In India alone, this is a $5 billion opportunity. Over the last 12 months, we have travelled across the country, from Madurai to Chandigarh and met over 500 small, medium and large businesses to validate our hypothesis. The problem is real and the opportunity in both tier-1 and 2 cities across the country is huge with no market leaders,"" asserts Balaji.While the company already has scored their first international client in Singapore, it will soon expand its footprints into other countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East.""We have taken this strategic decision to boost our sales, decrease time to market and get access to competitive markets. We plan to launch the product with direct sales and marketing in the Northern US by the first quarter of 2019. This is a huge $30 billion worldwide opportunity,"" says Balaji.All this growth and traction has been achieved by investing their own money so far, but the founders have plans to soon knock on the investors' doors. ""We will start our funding rounds soon. The goal is to raise a pre-Series A round by mid-2018, and scale the business,"" informs Balaji.The plan is to keep evolving the platform and provide the latest technology to their clients to enable remote workforce management. The founders are also in the process of building an operating system for field and remote workforce management. ""The future of field workforce management is IOT enabled connected devices and smart homes. We are actively working on enhancing the platform to enable Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality capabilities to offer an immersive and powerful experience for enterprise customers to ensure they can provide the most powerful tech to their field and remote employees to be the best in their business,"" says Balaji."

This news comes just a little over six months after the company announced it was fully registered with the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK). As previously reported, Modalku was founded in 2016 and is described as an online marketplace for small businesses to acquire loans and for lenders to fund small business loans to earn returns.

“Our technology-based approach enables borrowers to receive loans for the first time or at lower than market rates, while lenders will earn returns well above that of bank deposits, traditional fixed income products, and life insurance investment-linked products. This marketplace lending model is proven in countries such as USA, UK, China, [and] Singapore.”

Modalku currently operates in three countries Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, with operating as Funding Societies in Singapore and Malaysia. The company so far has received a few awards, such as Global Excellence Award by ITU Telecom. According to Digital News Asia, Reynold Wijaya, co-founder and CEO of Modalku, stated:

“We are very proud of Modalku’s achievements throughout 2017, especially to receive global acknowledgment that we provide positive value for Indonesian society while supporting national financial inclusion efforts. Of course, we would not have been able to attain our accomplishments without the support and trust of various parties, including the public, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and our lenders and borrowers. We are both grateful and motivated to be even better in 2018. We want to support more deserving MSMEs, in Indonesia and Southeast Asia.”

Tempo News: Crowdfunding Journalism, New Way to Get Powerful

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - We understand that the digital age brings a flood of information, now everyone has access to mass communication channels, especially through social media. At the same time, many of us concerned, not all the information floods are beneficial to audiences. The rise of the hoax, fake news and disinformation, make the public lose the grip of what is fact and real.

Mass media must provide solutions. Of course, netizen’s expectation from the media is not a lecture about the importance of verification, nor the one-sided action of raising an issue which is considered crucial by the editor. The media can take a new role by opening an equivalent public space and oriented to the interests of the people.

Therefore, Tempo.co cooperates with change.org and kitabisa.com makes 'Bongkar'. This initiative combines the power of change.org as an online petition site with more than 4 million users with the benefits of kitabisa.com as a crowdfunding site that in 2016 had successfully collected public funds collectively to Rp 61 billion, and integrated it with Tempo.co, an online news site which is part of the investigative journalism tradition of Magazine and Koran Tempo.

""Investigative journalism is crucial to support the function of public accountability and strengthen the democracy. In line with Change.org Indonesia's efforts to initiate, mobilize and win social campaigns, as part of efforts to strengthen democracy,"" said Desmarita Murni, Change.org's Director of Communications. She hopes this cooperation can raise investigative news that not only takes sides with the public interest but also in the process, driven by the active participation of netizens.

While Alfatih Timur, co-founder of kitabisa.com affirms that journalism not only needs to crowdsourcing in the content way, but also funding. ""So journalism is really from public to public,"" he said. By asking for opinions and funds from the public, said Alfatih, there is validation that the issues raised by the media are interesting and desirable by the community. ""We will ensure an easy, quick and transparent donation process to help the program,"" he said.

Philipus Parera, Head Project of 'Bongkar' who is also Executive Editor of Koran Tempo, affirmed that the crowdsourcing model for this kind of journalism has never been done before in Indonesia. ""All this time, the media has always tried to encourage public participation, but this kind of model is just tried for the first time,"" he said. He believes that netizen has been waiting for the opportunity to participate in determining the media agenda and directly involved in ensuring the continuity of the coverage process.

Here are the steps that must be taken by the netizen to get involved in this 'Bongkar' project:

1. You may choose one of the three issues that are submitted from Tempo editorial for further investigation, via https://change.org/bongkar

The online voting process will run for one month. The issue that gets the most votes will go to the next step of collective funding alias crowdfunding.

2. To provide voluntary funding, you are expected to log in to https://kitabisa.com/bongkar. All funds obtained from there will be managed by kitabisa.com and will be used only for the purpose of covering the issue by Tempo editors.

3. After one month of fundraising is over, Tempo editor will start working. The coverage result will be posted at https://investigasi.tempo.co.

For the first batch, the 'Bongkar' project offers three issues: (1) the disappearance of Jakarta Provincial Government assets, (2) the suffering of commercial sex workers who are victims of human trafficking and (3) the case of torturing circus animals, which is hidden for so many years.

What topic do you choose? You decide: Let's 'Bongkar!'

OJK to Issue Fintech Rules in First Semester

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Financial Services Authority (OJK) will issue rules on financial technology or fintech. The regulator is targeting to issue the rule by the first semester of 2018.

OJK chief Wimboh Santoso said the rule will cover the general issues on fintech.

""Principally, we encourage the development of fintech, as it benefits a lot of people,"" Wimboh said in Jakarta, Thursday, January 4.

Read: OJK to Issue Fintech Regulation Next Year

Wimboh said the rules are made to protect public interests, as there are risks in using fintech. Each fintech company will be required to be transparent about the risks their products offered.

The rule, however, does not specifically govern the ban on virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin. ""I have not issued the rules yet,"" he said.

Indonesia does not regulate the use of Bitcoins as an investment instrument. However, Bank Indonesia (BI) bans the use of Bitcoins as means of payment.

The company reportedly raised $1.3m in its previous funding round, in February 2017.

Unlike FoodPanda and Deliveroo, Dahmakan takes an end-to-end approach. Instead of delivering food from restaurants to customers’ homes, Dahmakan prepares the food in its own kitchens.

According to the TechCrunch report, Dahmakan is considering Indonesia and Thailand as potential new markets.

Interestingly, Dahmakan offers a “Prime” service, where customers can order 10 meals for RM199; 20 meals for RM379; and 50 meals for RM899 (and the delivery charge is built into the price). Customers who sign up for the Prime packages are also entitled to “exclusive 30 minute delivery windows”. Dahmakan’s delivery coverage area currently includes Kuala Lumpur and Puchong."

By maximizing the digital platform, people could experience fashion in real time by taking a glimpse at the runway backstage and even purchase pieces of the collection right after the fashion show.

Successfully organized in Singapore and Thailand, Digital Fashion Week (DFW) Jakarta 2017 is the manifestation of market readiness in injecting the digital experience, implemented through various activities. The fashion shows were run based on digital management, such as real time streaming, social media updates and take overs, and also included online to offline marketplace activities.

Held at Lamoda Plaza Indonesia Mall from December 13 to 15, DFW Jakarta 2017 stimulated effective and efficient interaction between designers, brands, and their customers.

DFW Jakarta 2017 showcased international designers and brands from various countries, such as Harry Halim (France), Chu Suwannapha (South Africa), Betty Tran (Australia), David Tlale (South Africa), Michelle Surjaputra (Indonesia), Mariano Ippolito (IT’s Lifestyle, Italy), and alumni from the Raffles Design Institute.

In collaboration with NowFashion.com, the Real Time Streaming Fashion Show could be accessed from anywhere around the globe, presenting a unique fashion experience complete with 360 virtual reality, live interaction and multiple camera feeds from different locations, allowing fashion lovers to access the full fledge of fashion week’s activities, from behind-the-scenes and rehearsals to runway collaborations.

The show also invited influencers, bloggers, vloggers, and fashion enthusiasts to attend the shows to create buzz on social media and in order to keep those who could not be at the venue up to date.

The “online-to-offline” marketplace of DWF could be seen at the Retail Pop-Up Store location. The committee hosted selling events scheduled right after each runway show, involving a total of 12 brands.

Managing Director of DFW Creative Charina Widjaja explained that the concept of the event was 100 percent concerned with the customer’s needs and wishes. All conventional activities moved through the digital world - a logical step, considering that digital communication is the fastest, cheapest, and most effective marketing tool, especially for designers involved in the shows.

“We wanted to provide a digital platform for the designers to market their products. We also gave people who couldn’t attend the fashion show the chance to experience what is happening through our online channels,” she said.

Charina added that DFW Jakarta 2017 created business opportunities and - hopefully - returned investment for the participating designers. According to her, Digital Fashion Week is not just a showcase for designers’ clothes or designs, but also about giving visitors access to buy the products instantly.

Besides the fashion shows, international experts shared insight on how to create success stories in the global fashion scene at the Fashion Forum. Digital fashion editor of Italian Vogue Elena Bara, global creative consultant Christelle Noviaire-Domec, founder of of NowFashion.com Valerio Mezzanotti, fashion communication marketing expert Valerio Nappi, and other global industry players further discussed the digitalization of the fashion world."

Editor’s note: This is the first part of a post on Southeast Asian e-commerce by Sheji Ho, for the second part click here. Sheji Ho is the Group Chief Marketing Officer at aCommerce, an end-to-end e-commerce enabler in Southeast Asia. Currently based in Bangkok but having previously worked in China, Sheji writes about e-commerce, tech, the internet, and how Southeast Asia is the next China.

Alibaba’s entry into Southeast Asia served as social proof for many entrepreneurs and businesses that they were onto something big, which led to a year of exuberance for e-commerce in the region.

“We’re just at the beginning, [the Alibaba-Lazada deal] will kickstart the whole cycle. It will attract more global investments into the region, and attract more entrepreneurs who now see this region as a great place to start a business,” Stefan Jung, founding partner at Indonesia-based Venturra Capital said in an interview with Tech in Asia.

Even as we get closer to 2018, there are already numerous casualties in one of the most promising e-commerce growth markets in the world.

Alibaba doubled down on its Lazada investment by upping its share from 51 percent to 83 percent and, in a push to monopolize the market, put grips on Tokopedia, arguably one of Lazada’s biggest competitors in Indonesia.

Tencent, through JD or directly, also began executing its China playbook by investing in companies like Sea, Go-Jek, Traveloka, Pomelo Fashion and Tiki.vn. Global attention from the US came from KKR who put $65 million into e-commerce ‘arms dealer’ aCommerce through Emerald Media in a bid to replicate Baozun’s dominance in the Chinese “TP” (Tmall Partner) landscape.

And the plays won’t stop here.

Leveraging newly consolidated positions of strength, marketplaces will cross traditional boundaries and move into areas like private label brands and offline distribution. Brands will also feel increasingly cornered, facing a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation.

Those that survive 2018 will have to find a niche for themselves, such as in fashion or home because there isn’t much room left for another horizontal e-commerce player. Others will be tempted to take risky shortcuts like say, raising money through ICOs. 2018 will also see Tencent, not Alibaba or a local company, emerge as the winner in mobile payments in Southeast Asia.

It might be a good time to start learning Chinese.

1. Plata o Plomo: Southeast Asia e-commerce will be increasingly factionalized into Alibaba and Tencent camps, and locals will pick sides

Given its similarities to China roughly 10 years ago, Southeast Asia has become a gold rush for Chinese Internet giants looking to expand beyond the mainland. It was Alibaba’s acquisition of Lazada last year that triggered an arms race between China’s #1 and #2 in Southeast Asia, and in turn, will cause local companies to choose sides.

Alibaba also led a $1.1 billion investment in Tokopedia in 2017, continuing to place its biggest bets on e-commerce. Moving forward, the company is expected to position Lazada and Tokopedia as the Tmall and Taobao of Southeast Asia, respectively.

Meanwhile, Tencent has aggressively tried to replicate a three-prong formula that was successful in its fight against Alibaba in China: gaming, mobile and payments. The first step was becoming the largest shareholder of Sea (previously Garena), predominantly a gaming powerhouse that runs Shopee, a mobile-first e-commerce marketplace, and the second was placing bets on Go-Jek to become a “super app” like WeChat and WeChat Pay. Understandable as WeChat Pay now commands an impressive 40% market share in China vs. AliPay’s 54%, up from 11% in 2015.

“Is there a land grab right now for these kinds of assets? I think in the land grab they [Tencent] are following us. They are seeing that we have positioned ourselves very well, and they’re sort of playing a catch-up game. So what we want to do is, since we already have our positions, is to work with local entrepreneurs,” Joe Tsai, Alibaba Vice Chairman, said while speaking to Bloomberg.

With both Tencent and Alibaba market caps at all-time highs, we expect this trend to continue throughout 2018 with both sides gobbling up more local companies across the e-commerce ecosystem and upping shares in existing ones.

2. Facing slow organic growth, Amazon will acquire a company to fast-track its e-commerce expansion in the emerging region

Amazon’s “entry into Southeast Asia” was the biggest surprise and non-surprise at the same time. A non-surprise because Amazon’s long-awaited and rumored soft-launch into Singapore was widely covered by the media even before the company’s Prime Now services officially became available on July 26, 2017. A surprise because Amazon’s expected tour-de-force across the region ended before it even started.

Amazon fanboys celebrated the initial launch of a scaled down, poor man’s version of Amazon—Amazon Prime Now—offering a measly one million household items and daily essentials.

“I was expecting more things that I can’t get in Singapore, for example, Sriracha or something small that’s not available in Singapore but most stuff on Prime Now are basic things you can get from Fairprice…” said Reddit user Ticklishcat.

But there’s a good reason for it. It doesn’t make sense for Amazon to set up a full-blown local presence in the country-state. Singaporeans, under the Free AmazonGlobal Saver Shipping option, were already enjoying free international shipping from Amazon en masse for orders over US$125. The country ranks #29 in terms of session/year to Amazon.com on a global scale but #4 when normalized for population size. With an average of 14.04 sessions per person per year visiting Amazon.com, Singapore takes the top spot among all the countries in Asia.

Singaporeans are already buying from Amazon, without the latter’s full-fledged local presence: Singapore ranking only #29 in traffic to Amazon.com but #4 when normalized for population size (#1 in Asia)

The launch of Amazon Prime in Singapore earlier this month makes it even less likely for the firm to set up local operations beyond Amazon Prime Now. Amazon is no longer subsidizing the original free shipping for orders above US$125 to Singapore and Singaporean Prime members have free international delivery only on orders above S$60 on Amazon’s US website for S$8.99 per month in addition to other benefits.

Not much else has been heard about the company’s further expansion into the region, particularly Indonesia and Thailand, where markets are being rapidly carved up by Alibaba and Tencent. With time running out for a full-fledged, organic entry into the high-growth markets of Southeast Asia, its stock trading at all-time highs, and not too distant memories of failure in China, we expect Amazon to attempt at least one major acquisition in 2018 to accelerate regional expansion.

3. Offline is the new online: pure-play e-commerce to launch physical stores to offset rising online customer acquisition costs and improve last-mile fulfillment

While traditional offline retailers like Central in Thailand and Matahari in Indonesia scrambled to move business online, online pure-play e-commerce is expected to make moves offline. With online customer acquisition channels like Google and Facebook rapidly reaching saturation and diminishing returns, e-commerce players like Pomelo and Lazada will look to offline channels to reach new customers.

Pomelo dabbled in offline over the last few years but, fresh off a $19 million Series B financing round, recently launched its biggest pop-up to date in Siam Square, the fashion center of Bangkok. The store applies “click-and-collect”, enabling customers to order online and try items in store before deciding which ones to keep or return.

“In fashion, the number one barrier to purchase is still the need to try the product on for fit coupled with the hassle of returns. An offline footprint addresses this barrier head on. Additionally, customers can be acquired offline and data from online can be used to drive higher sales and greater operational efficiencies offline. In short, a mix of offline and online is the optimal strategy for fashion retail going forward,” said David Jou, co-founder and CEO of Pomelo Fashion

Love Bonito, another online-first fashion brand from Singapore, officially launched its permanent flagship store at Orchard Road after seven years of being an e-commerce pure-play.

Lazada, on the other hand, may follow Alibaba’s moves in China where the e-commerce juggernaut launched Hema supermarkets in Beijing and Shanghai. In addition to reinforcing a positive brand experience and customer acquisition, these new offline stores serve as fulfillment centers, effectively making up for Southeast Asia’s lack of logistics infrastructure.

Lazada Group CEO Max Bittner already hinted at the possibility physical stores in Indonesia at a conference earlier this year.

Over the last decade in China, Alibaba rode 50%+ year-on-year e-commerce growth to become what it is today, however, as maturation slows, Alibaba has doubled-down on initiatives like Single’s Day (11.11), “New Retail” (smart pop-up stores around China), and market expansion to accelerate sales (Southeast Asia).

Despite the region being projected as the next big e-commerce growth story, online accounts for only 1-2% of total retail today. If companies like Lazada and Shopee want to grow faster than the market allows, going offline will be the obvious choice.

4. New e-commerce startups will use ICOs to raise funding to battle giants

With Southeast Asia increasingly being carved up by giants such as Alibaba and Tencent in a presumed winner-takes-all-market, smaller e-commerce startups will look at alternative ways to finance themselves. Enter newly hyped Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Raising funds through these means in Southeast Asia was pioneered by Omise, a fintech startup based in Thailand, that successfully raised $25 million in a few hours to develop a decentralized payment system.

Given early speculation of Amazon moving into the cryptocurrency space, we’ll have fertile ground for our first Southeast Asian e-commerce ICO. Already a startup called HAMSTER is selling HMT tokens to develop a decentralized marketplace that promises “no fees, no brokers”.

Revolutionary e-commerce platform funded by ICOs or a Ponzi scheme?

Expect e-commerce startups to use ICOs to fund customer acquisition, new product development, and inventory financing. That is, until the bubble bursts…

5. A final wave of e-commerce consolidation sweeps through as local players adjust to a New World Order

We’ve shared numerous stories of casualties and consolidation during the Southeast Asian e-commerce bloodbath in our previous annual predictions. Japan’s Rakuten sold off most of its assets in the region when it retreated in 2015/2016. Rocket Internet dumped Zalora Thailand and Vietnam in a fire sale in 2016 and sold its Philippines entity to local conglomerate Ayala Group the year after.

In Thailand, Ascend Group put its assets WeLoveShopping and WeMall on life support to focus on fintech. In Indonesia, reports surfaced of SK Planet selling its Elevenia shares to Indonesian conglomerate Salim Group, which was quickly followed by news of its Malaysian entity up for bid between Alibaba and JD. Earlier in the year, Indonesia’s second largest telco Indosat Ooredoo shut down its e-commerce website Cipika. Alfamart, Indonesia’s second largest convenience store chain also had to downsize operations to pivot its e-commerce initiative Alfacart away from a general marketplace play towards an online grocery channel.

Come 2018, all eyes will be on the health of remaining bastions of home-grown, horizontal e-commerce plays. As Alibaba and Tencent up the ante, there will definitely be more casualties in the new year.

London-based insurtech firm Anorak Technologies has secured £4 million seed funding from Kamet Ventures (a €100 million incubator funded by AXA). Anorak has built a suite of APIs to integrate with existing services, like online banking and ecommerce
Its plan is to use data science and machine learning to give people “access to the knowledge and advice of a broker, without having to see one”. The firm collects data about a person’s family, home, income and finances. The service analyses how much cover they need, for how long and why. Then, having scanned and rated policy documents from all insurers, and analysed pages of small print, Anorak “finds the best policy to suit the person’s unique circumstances”.

Singapore-based crowdfunding platform Funding Societies has passed the SGD 100 million ($75.8 million) mark in total crowdfunded SME loans across Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
It says this is the highest total crowdfunded amount reached by any P2P lending platform in South-east Asia. Founded in early 2015, Funding Societies is a licensed digital platform that connects SMEs with retail and institutional investors. In 2016, it received SGD 10 million ($7.3 million) funding led by Sequoia India and expansion into Indonesia and Malaysia.
Mekar (which means “Blossom”), an Indonesian fintech start-up, is looking for financing from foreign venture capital investors as it looks expand its microcredit lending service both within and outside the country. Thierry Sanders, chief executive officer of Mekar, told the South China Morning Post it has intermediated micro loans totalling $7 million, typically at $250 per loan. Like many firms it is targeting the unbanked or underbanked. It reckons it can tap into the micro loan market for small farmers and shop-owners across the 17,000 islands making up the Indonesian archipelago.
According to Mekar, it uses machine learning technology to help approve loans by checking if the applicant’s facial features matches with the photo on their identity cards. The investors of these loans are Indonesian banks, such as Bank Woori Saudara and Bank Sampoerna. Sanders told SCMP that over the next two months, the platform will also be opened to foreign investors to invest in microloans on its platform."

JAKARTA, NNC – The Ministry of Trade cooperates with two representatives of the Indonesian marketplaces as an effort to spur non-oil and gas export growth through electronic commerce (e-commerce). The two marketplaces are Blibli.com and Ralali.com.
""E-commerce has enormous potential to increase exports. E-commerce can be utilized by national business actors to export more easily, quickly and efficiently. In addition, it also has a positive impact on various business lines related to logistics services, financing and communication; minimizing costs; and expanding the marketing area,"" said Director of Export Development Cooperation Marolop Nainggolan, in a press release on Monday (9/10/2018).
Bibli.com and Ralali.com were present at a seminar held by the Ministry of Trade's Directorate General of National Export Development on September 5, 2018, in Bandung, West Java. The seminar with the theme ""Utilization of E-Commerce in Increasing National Exports"" was attended by 50 Indonesian export entrepreneurs.
During the seminar, representatives from Blibli.com conveyed various ease and benefits of transacting using marketing pages while representatives from Ralali.com gave a presentation on how to sell through electronic commerce and short training in photo taking. Quality of product photos is very important to attract buyers in buying products offered when shopping online.
Along with the increasing number of internet users in Indonesia, the value of transactions through the use of digital marketing has also increased. According to the survey results of the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (APJII), internet users in Indonesia in 2017 reached 143.26 million people, up 7.95 percent compared to 2016 which was 132.7 million people. The number of internet users in 2017 represented 54.68 percent of Indonesia's total population of 260 million.
In 2014 the e-commerce transaction value stood at IDR34 trillion, which increased in 2016 to IDR260 trillion. By 2020, the value of e-commerce transactions is expected to surge to IDR1,690 trillion."
2;770916157;20180710;2018;http://www.gulf-times.com/story/599050/A-new-term-is-born-Shariah-fintech-and-it-has-quit;" Indonesia’s Deputy Finance Minister Mardiasmo at the country’s third Annual Islamic Finance Conference in Makassar on July 4 in his opening speech was using a relatively new term that will play an important role in Islamic finance: “Shariah fintech,” meaning financial technology compliant with Islamic laws and beliefs.
Mardiasmo, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name, told the audience that “to accelerate the process of strengthening the role of Islamic finance, we need to think out of the box, including by taking recent technological advancement into consideration,” and added that he believed that “harnessing Shariah fintech would have a positive impact on this issue.”
Shariah fintech is clearly a new buzzword to describe the venture of financial technology into Islamic finance. It came into gear in the second half of last year, with a handful of Shariah fintech events held mainly in Malaysia to introduce the Islamic finance community to this new development.
The status quo is that few Islamic banks have been open to adapt new technologies, pointing out that even though technology is neutral from Shariah perspective in general, fintech applications would still require sensitivity in that aspect. Furthermore, many scholars in Shariah boards of established Islamic financial institution are possibly a bit challenged in this particular case of progress meeting tradition.
The result is that not Islamic banks are the drivers for Shariah fintech; but startups, entrepreneurs and inventive enterprises. In Indonesia, for example, and in other Asian countries with growing Muslim populations and expanding economies, online microfinance services are part of this new wave of Shariah fintech and mostly startups are rushing to ride it, like BTPN Syariah and Blossom Finance in Indonesia or FINTQ in the southern Philippines, just to name a few.
Other Shariah fintech startups are focusing on agri-finance platforms, Islamic crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending and mobile payment applications, while others are developing blockchain solutions for Islamic finance services, automated halal investment and trading platforms, robo-advisers for Islamic investments and Shariah-compliant cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings.
Among Islamic banks, just a few so far are explicitly looking for talent and setting up research and development centres for Shariah fintech, for example CIMB and Maybank in Malaysia, a number of banks in the UAE, as well as Bank Mandiri and Bank Rakyat in Indonesia, among others.
And there is also the question which country will take the lead in Shariah fintech. Last December, a consortium of three Bahraini banks as a first announced the establishment of a company dedicated to research and development in the Shariah fintech sector, ALGO Bahrain.
In addition, in February 2018, the largest dedicated fintech hub in the Middle East and Africa, Bahrain FinTech Bay, operated by Singapore-based fintech incubator FinTech Consortium, opened in Manama.
However, US-based business intelligence firm Pew Research Center found in a recent study that fintech firms that comply with Shariah laws can be found in their highest number in Malaysia, the UK and Indonesia, in that order, and are followed by the UAE, the US, India and Egypt.
Islamic finance advisors agree that there is an urgent need to push for necessary legislation and regulation, infrastructure support and technology enablement for Shariah fintech. So far, Islamic startups are on their own, presenting complex explanations why their fintech innovations are halal, while other fintechs are endorsed by specific fatwas. The common stance seems to be that innovations in fintech become impermissible only if there is clear evidence that they are in conflict against the basic finance rules of Shariah. 
In Indonesia’s case, Mardiasmo came to the conclusion that “we need to deepen understanding of Shariah knowledge among fintech players so that they can comply with Shariah-based regulations.” That way, growth of Shariah fintech would become “the catalyst to increase the share of Islamic banks in the country’s financial services,” he concluded."

Ma did not say when the Jack Ma Institute of Entrepreneurs would launch, but said the aim was to train 1,000 tech leaders a year over the next 10 years.

""We're giving a lot of opportunities for young Indonesian people to learn,"" Ma told reporters after meeting Indonesian ministers on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings being hosted by Indonesia.

The co-founder of Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce firm, said it is important for Indonesia to invest in human capital because ""only when people improve, when people's minds change, when people's skills improve, then we can enter the digital period"".

Indonesia has a shortage of trained engineers in technology and the institute will also train hundreds of developers and engineers on cloud computing to help make Indonesian businesses more digital-savvy.

The country is a key market for Alibaba, whose cloud computing arm Alibaba Cloud launched a data centre in Indonesia in March.

Ma said his company would continue to invest ""not only on e-commerce, but also cloud computing, logistics and...infrastructure"" in Indonesia, while also helping local businesses to grow.

Indonesian Communications Minister Rudiantara told Reuters in September that Indonesia was partnering with Ma to look into ways to harness Alibaba's businesses to increase its exports, particularly to China.

McKinsey estimated in a report released on Aug. 30 that the value of Indonesia's e-commerce market will surge to at least $55 billion (£42 billion) by 2022 from $8 billion in 2017.

On Friday, Ma told a panel discussion at the IMF and World Bank meetings that ""the internet is designed for developing countries"", with ""great opportunities in Africa"" also."

The Mumbai-based company, earlier called Faasos Food Services, is in the process of closing its latest round of equity financing, estimated at $35 million, which is likely to see existing backer, marquee venture firm Sequoia Capital put in $10-15 million in the eight-year-old firm, persons cited earlier told ET.

The round, which has already seen entry of new backers Sistema Asia Fund and UAE-based Evolvence, values the company at $200-220 million, according to persons cited earlier. Lightbox, an early backer, has also participated in this round.

Jaydeep Barman, chief executive, Faasos, declined comment. An email sent to Sequoia Capital remained unanswered till time of press.

Sources also said some of Faasos’ early investors are likely to either completely or partially exit in an ongoing secondary transaction. Sequoia Capital, they said, is also contemplating raising its stake.

Separately, Faasos is believed to have received significant interest from investors, including private equity and hedge funds, for a possible $75-million round, at a potential valuation of $300-330 million—a premium of 40-50% over the ongoing round. If successful, this new round could close by December 2018 or January next year.

South African media and internet conglomerate Naspers is also believed to have held exploratory talks for an investment, but this could not be independently confirmed. An email sent to Naspers did not elicit a response till late Thursday.

Faasos has been one of the few bright spots in the Indian food tech space, which three years ago had emerged as a darling of investors, but then also sank swiftly after startups were unable to bring in the required operational efficiencies, leading to unsustainable burn rates.

The company — founded by Insead and McKinsey alum Barman and Kallol Banerjee, also from Insead and then Bosch — operates an estimated 1,100 internet restaurants. Last month, ET reported the company was preparing to establish its first batch of multi-brand cloud kitchens in Dubai, making an international foray. It will have three kitchens operational in the city by the first quarter of 2019, which will see the firm launch its brands Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story and Firangi Bake in the Middle East. It expects to launch in Indonesia and the UK in the latter half of 2019.

The company has projected net revenue of Rs 300-350 crore for fiscal 2019. It ended financial year 2017-18 with Rs 147 crore in net revenue and cut its loss by half from FY17, when it had clocked a loss of Rs 82 crore."

Notably, at the end of last year, it was named one of the world’s Top 20 internet users with 64 million connected people and in January this year, Vietnam claimed the title of the world’s fastest growing wealth hub, clocking in 210 percent wealth growth between 2007 and 2017.This is the reason that Forbes declared the country ‘every keen investor’s must-watch’ for 2018. Besides, It means that Vietnam sits at the beautiful intersection where personal finance meets inevitable innovation.In the last five years alone, Vietnam has experienced the entry of over 40 new fintech players, such as online payment platforms Mobivi and Momo, as well as the country’s first fully digital bank Timo.One of these is financial products comparison platform GoBear, one of Asia’s fastest growing startups that has recently undergone leadership renewal.Its new CEO, serial fintech entrepreneur and merchant bank Fintonia founder Adrian Chng, works closely with country director for Vietnam Bao Nguyen to increase the Vietnamese population’s direct access to financial services, with a platform that has already delivered unbiased financial comparisons to 34 million users across Asia since its launch barely three years ago.Adrian thinks it was only a matter of time before technology became primed to boost the personal financial services sector in emerging markets.The new CEO said, “It is an interesting situation because on one hand we have fast-growing and young populations with high mobile phone penetration across the region, but on the other, still relatively low penetration of traditional financial services like credit cards, loans or insurance. Because of logistical constraints, traditional distribution forms like physical bank branches cannot play in this space so it was only a matter of time before technology stepped in to improve efficiencies. When that happened, technology allowed financial institutions to access to the full spectrum of consumers.”Technology does this by making it easier for people to get connected and subsequently look for financial services online, which significantly improves customer acquisition costs. Increased connectivity and prolonged online activity also means people are now producing larger digital footprints than ever before.But how do companies even begin to harness this data, let alone make sense of it? Cue another way technology can bridge for banks and insurance companies, including on top of mining that data for precious insights, fintech is increasingly contributing to developing new models of assessment—even for the unbanked. It is the biggest opportunity yet to truly reduce the costs of acquisition.In Vietnam, GoBear has demonstrated consistent development in numerous areas throughout the past year, despite being one of the group’s newer market entries.As of today, GoBear Vietnam’s local site www.gobear.com/vn is landing over two million monthly pageviews and one million monthly users.Bao, outlining further plans for Vietnam, said, “Our key priority now is to broaden the variety of products on the GoBear Vietnam platform. We are doing this in tandem with continuously enhancing the seamless user experience, such as advanced search and filter options to help users find the best products.”He continued, “This year, GoBear Vietnam has already added home loans, home equity loans, and car loans, with life insurance and digital wallet coming soon. We are also working to integrate a personal pre-approval feature that will improve financial inclusion and financial access for our users. Our ultimate goal is to improve the standard of living for Vietnamese people who have limited access to mainstream financial services.”It is perfect timing. GoBear currently offers more than 2,000 personal finance products across its soon-to-be seven markets (it will be launching in Indonesia this coming October), including personal loans. It sees strong growth opportunities in cash-based economies, where the challenge for everyday folk is borrowing from traditional lenders.Chiming back in, Adrian shared, “Emerging economies are hotbeds for personal loans because they are teeming with businesses being formed every day. People who have started taking loans will now start looking for forms of financial protection or insurance. This is the classic curve for the life cycle of personal financial services. After that, the next level of sophistication will come from people moving up the curve and looking for wealth and asset management products, particularly in the more developed markets. We can already see a lot of fintech companies in Southeast Asian markets trying to tap into personal loans and insurance.”But the question is where does GoBear plan to fit into all of this. According to Adrian, being an internet technology innovator first and foremost means that all the data it has acquired has allowed it to deeply understand new consumer behaviours, which continue to reveal deep insights to drive product innovation, including funding new types of insurance products altogether.Adrian concluded, “Imagine a travel insurance plan that has been made just for you, using the data on your smartphone that has been harnessed from the places you have travelled, andplaces on your bucket list. Acquiring more and more data and insights every day, GoBear is perfectly placed to partner with financial institutions on their product innovations. We can help them create whole new ranges of services and products. This adds significant value to the financial services ecosystem, and it’s enabling us to expand beyond our current business model.”VIR

Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, signed
an agreement in London on 22 March, 2018 to establish a FinTech bridge. 
The UK-Australia FinTech Bridge will deepen collaboration
between governments, regulators, and industry bodies in the two countries. It
will also support improved access for Australian FinTech firms to the UK
market.
The FinTech Bridge includes collaboration between Australian
and UK governments to identify emerging FinTech trends and policy issues,
enabling better policy positions. Regulatory expertise will be shared between
Australia and the UK, through closer cooperation between the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC),
Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)  and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
The regulatory authorities will facilitate the entry of
FinTech start-ups into each jurisdiction’s regulatory sandbox and explore
opportunities for quicker licence processing for FinTech firms that are already
licenced or authorised in the other country.
Joint projects will also be undertaken to identify shared
approaches and identify links between Australia and the UK.
Austrade and the
UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT)
will provide support for FinTech firms looking to expand into the other market.
This support includes providing bespoke advice and mentorship to FinTech firms
looking to expand into the UK or Australia. They will also provide a ‘one stop
shop service’ to enable firms to access legal, regulatory and practical advice
about setting up in a new market.
Matchmaking events, meetings and networking opportunities
will be facilitated for companies with potential partnership prospects, and introductions
to investors will be provided, assisted by specialist teams at Austrade and
DIT.
The collaboration also includes promoting engagement between
Australian and UK FinTech sector bodies, led by FinTech Australia and the UK’s Innovate Finance, to discuss
collaboration opportunities between FinTech businesses.
UK FinTech firms generate £7 billion in revenue annually,
employ over 61,000 people and in 2017 raised £1.3 billion of investment. Investment
in Australian FinTech in 2016 reached a high of over US$656 million. Australia
is also the second largest alternative finance market in the Asia Pacific.
Australia’s supportive
regulatory settings and high rate of FinTech adoption presents an
attractive market for the launch and expansion of FinTech products.
In his speech at the International FinTech Conference, Mr
Morrison said, “Thanks to the support of Austrade and the UK’s Department of
International Trade, the Bridge will give businesses tailored assistance to
navigate the complexities of operating in a foreign market, such as connections
for legal, regulatory and practical advice about setting up between the two
markets.”
“These agencies will give FinTechs a networking leg-up,
while a collaboration between FinTech industry groups will facilitate stronger
business-to-business links in the sector. This is a critical aspect needed to
foster development in this fast-paced sector.”
He also highlighted existing collaboration, such as agreement
signed
in March 2017 between the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)’s London Innovation Lab
and Austrade to support Fintech innovation exchange and investment between
Australia and the UK.
In February this year, ING and CBA undertook
a RegTech pilot in collaboration with FinTech firms and the FCA in London
which demonstrated the potential for artificial intelligence and natural
language processing in order to simplify the ways businesses meet their
regulatory compliance obligations.
ASIC has been collaborating closely with regulators in other
jurisdictions to understand developments, and to help entrepreneurs expand
their target markets into other jurisdictions.
Previously, ASIC has entered into FinTech referral and
information-sharing agreements with many regulatory authorities, including the Financial
Markets Authority of New Zealand, Monetary
Authority of Singapore, the United
Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, Ontario
Securities Commission, Hong
Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Japan
Financial Services Agency, Malaysia
Securities Commission and Abu
Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority. In addition,
information-sharing agreements have been entered with the Capital
Markets Authority, Kenya and Otoritas
Jasa Keuangan (Financial Services Authority of Indonesia), Indonesia.

made by the Ministry
of Communication and Informatics (KOMINFO) highlighted the launch of
the Del Arrbey Coding and Start-up Academy (DACSA). DACSA’s objective is to
produce talents with programming or coding skills that will satisfy the need
for human resources in response to the Industrial Revolution 4.0. 
The Minister of Communications and
Informatics Rudiantara showed appreciation for the launch of the Del Arrbey
Coding and Start-up Academy (DACSA) which aims to meet the needs of the human
resources (HR) for programming and coding talents. According to him, Indonesia
is lagging behind its neighbours, especially Singapore, at present. 
“The big issue that Indonesia has is the
lack of people equipped with the knowledge of coding. Coding is not just the
language of the program, but also it is the reason behind the creation of a new
process. Coding is late in Indonesia is. Coding is missing in Indonesia,” he said
during the launch of Del Arrbey Coding and Start-up Academy (DACSA) in Sopo Del
Tower Jakarta, on 31 May 2018.
The Minister mentioned three stages in the
introduction of coding, “Start with the long term, then the short term, and
continued promotion and communication.”
According to him, long term meant including
coding in the SMK curriculum. It needs to be done; he had submitted the
initiative to the previous Minister of Education and Culture (KEMDIKBUD),
Anies Baswedan, as well as the current Minister in office, Muhadjir Effendy.
""The sources of talents in the digital
world start-up are collectively known as the 3Bs: the Bay area in San
Francisco, Beijing, and Bangalore. Indonesia is late. Coding has been taught in
Singapore even before kindergarten. We cannot compare to Singapore, but the
idea is similar,” he added.
Short term meant that students should be
encouraged to learn at home on their own at the high school level. 
As for promotion and communication, Indonesia
can initiate activities involving coding such as coding day, coding camp, and
even offer coding internships.
Introducing coding is one way to deal with the
Industrial Revolution 4.0. The Minister said, “We must respond by accepting the
change. The industrial revolution is a result of the advent of technology and
we should adjust to by changing the process.”
Arrbey Consulting
Chief Strategy Consultant Handito Joewono narrated how the birth of this DACSA thinking
began. He said that it was the brainchild of some of the officials of the Del Technology
Institute. 
“From that meeting, the desire to make
something more meaningful not only in Medan and North Sumatra, but also for the
whole of Indonesia, was born. And if possible, even in the whole world. Let's
start with the Del Arrbey Coding and Start-up Academy (DACSA),” he added.
Mr Handito also hopes that this activity will aid
other start-ups in becoming the next unicorn. Unicorns are companies that have
reached US$1 billion in valuation.

12;786997689;20180914;2018;https://www.opengovasia.com/indonesia-furthers-e-commerce-and-innovation/;"According to a recent report, Indonesia is the largest e-commerce marketplace in Southeast Asia. The online transactions in the country have amounted to US$ 5 billion, while transactions through informal e-commerce have reached US$ 3 billion.
It is estimated that there are around 30 million Indonesian citizens who transact through online marketplaces.
In a recent Universitas Gadjah Mada conference with the theme, “Shaping the Future of Digital Economy: Trends, Opportunity, and Challenge”, it was expressed that the e-commerce marketplace is projected to grow 8 times more.
The projection is that it will grow from transactions that amounted to US$ 8 billion in 2017 to around US$ 55 – 65 billion by the year 2022.
There are several reasons why there is a rapid growth of e-commerce in the country.
One reason could be the rise in the number of smartphone users as well as the millennial generation who are driving the digital world.
Another reason could be attributed to the increasing involvement of entrepreneurs or small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in online marketing.
Add to that, the investment in e-commerce made and the government policies that were done in support of them.
Although a start-up agreed with the explanation that the rise of digital economy was accelerated because of the large number of internet users in Indonesia, there still exists a gap between e-commerce in Java and outside of the island.
It is expected that infrastructure development will boost the digital economic growth beyond Java.
The characteristics of the digital economy, which has been greatly shaped by the millennial generation, are straightforward, direct, and very efficient.
Digitising technology has become a necessity based from the studies made on the trends in digitisation on economy and business.
As reported, during the recent National and International Science Event with the theme, “Research and Innovation for Economy in Industry 4.0”, the Ministry for Research, Technology and Higher Education called on scientists and modifiers to improve their capacity to initiate, implement, and develop research.
Innovation from research is a key for the country to become a winner.  The scientists are encouraged to be more creative when developing innovation as this is much needed for the 4.0 Industrial Revolution Era.
Indonesia should be able to rely on its own resources and be able to spur competitiveness.
It is essential that the research and innovation produced by both higher education institutions and research institutions are in line with the needs of the industry.
With the onset of the 4.0 Industrial Revolution Era, there is a need for the reformulation of higher education priorities in order for it to become more relevant with the global development trend.

(OTC Markets: SMRN) is pleased to announce that on February 27, 2018, Smartag International, Inc. (""Smartag,"" ""we"" or the ""Company) entered into a joint venture agreement with PT. Supratama Makmur Sejahtera (""PTSMS""), an Indonesian Fintech company to form a Joint Venture Indonesian PMA company in which Smartag will own 51% equity and PTSMS will own 49%. This follows an earlier MOU signed on October 12, 2017 between PTSMS and PT Rijan Dinamis Selaras (""RDS"") representing Pondok Pesantren Riyadhul Jannah Pacer Mojokerjo, founder of Consultative Assembly of Indonesian Boarding Schools which has a network of 28,000 boarding schools to undertake a Fintech project (the ""Indonesian Project"").
The new Indonesian PMA company plans to undertake the Indonesian Project to provide a rural e-Wallet Fintech services to approximately 10,000 boarding school students which are owned by many local Islamic Baitu Maal or BMT co-operatives within 3-5 years.  Currently, many of these BMT co-operatives already have their own basic desktop versions of legalized rural micro finance and pawn brokering businesses. Smartag intends to combine these different business platforms into one mobile Fintech platform which will provide students e-Wallet services as well as the current BMT micro financing and pawn broking services. This platform will also be available to students' immediate family members. The rural villages will benefit from various subset features ranging from rural e-Commerce supplies of basic food stuff via linked up basic mom & pop stores to micro-financing and pawn brokering.
Smartag plans to leverage its previous experience with food traceability and e-Commerce as key pillars of the new strategy to venture into Fintech, starting with the Indonesian Project. In particular, its past expertise and inroads within the GS1 supply chain community using EPCIS will serve as the cornerstone to venture into new sharia traceability using cryptography and key knowledge protocol. Smartag's solutions will enable peers to negotiate services, process and retrieve data, verification on integrity and availability and at the same time transfer of funds versus goods. At the same time, Smartag's previous 3 years venture with Shenzhen Shen Nan Shun (""SSNST"") in e-Commerce fits well with the Indonesian Project. With the recent agreement signed with SSNST/HK Vander to form a Joint Venture company in Hong Kong, Smartag intends to further strengthen its expertise to reach the potentially huge rural South-east Asian communities. With the principle factors of connectivity via smartphone telecommunications having been mostly resolved, Smartag believes that it has at least a three year lead ahead of the big international e-Commerce competitors, many of them who will stay in the urban areas due to unfamiliarity with e-logistics.
With this Indonesian Project and the corresponding agreement with the BMT co-operative network, which is one of the largest group of identifiable rural communities within South-east Asia (with a total country population of approximately in Indonesia alone of 300 million), Smartag aims to capture approximately 10% or 30 million e-wallet users within 3 to five years.

Established in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing phone service, Go-Jek is now a technology company with an on-demand mobile platform and application, providing services that include transportation, logistics, mobile payments, food delivery, and many other on-demand services.
The startup has raised about USD 100 million from JD.com and it is raising up to USD 1 billion from existing and new investors in its latest funding round, having a pre-money valuation of about USD 2.5 billion, according to Reuters.
